1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,511
Let's go.

3
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,850
MEMORIAL GATE

4
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,938
Chief, I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

5
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,903
Yes, what is it?

6
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>This is Yongju Silver Care Hospital.</i>

7
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,574
<i>We can't locate Mr. Na Jin-cheol.</i>

8
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>Your number was listed</i>
<i>as the emergency contact, so I called you.</i>

9
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,246
Okay, I'll be right there.

10
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,125
What's the matter?

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,379
There seems to be an issue
with my father-in-law.

12
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,923
Oh, no. Then you should hurry.

13
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,302
Use my official vehicle.
They'll get you there quickly and safely.

14
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,615
Oh, dear.

15
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,908
Are you okay?

16
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,750
What?

17
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,838
Why are they coming towards us?

18
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,423
- Did we do something wrong?
- No way!

19
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,591
We didn't do anything.

20
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,908
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

21
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,578
You may leave now.

22
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,620
Pardon?

23
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,165
I'll come to the station
to file the report.

24
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm sorry,
but what's your relationship with her?

25
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,753
We're family.

26
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,338
Excuse me?

27
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,805
She is…

28
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,266
my wife.

29
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,815
Stay here.

30
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,653
- My wife gave this case to me.
- He's Paik Sa-eon.

31
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,533
I have a favor to ask.

32
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,161
Yes, please go ahead.

33
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,955
I'll visit as soon as I can
to file the report.

34
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,376
In the meantime, please keep
our personal information private.

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
Yes, of course.

36
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,006
We'll ensure strict security.

37
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,966
Thank you.

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,051
By the way…

39
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,512
- Don't do it. Don't.
- I also have a favor to ask.

40
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,724
I know this isn't the greatest situation,

41
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,352
but may I get a picture with you?

42
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,605
If you keep your promise,

43
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,191
I'll take a picture with you
at the station.

44
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,026
I see. Okay.

45
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,904
- Well, then.
- Okay, see you again.

46
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,614
Go safely.

47
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,634
Your father's nurse…

48
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,136
has my number.

49
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,724
Anyway, we should move him
to a different nursing home.

50
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,022
How could he go so far?

51
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,402
From now on,

52
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,281
you don't have to worry about your father.

53
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,324
I'll take care of it.

54
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,469
You're making sounds.

55
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,394
Hong Hee-joo…

56
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,272
can make sounds.

57
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,161
You look so ugly right now.

58
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,837
I'm not telling you to stop crying.

59
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,924
Cry as much as you want.

60
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,290
{\an8}One <i>tteokbokki</i> set with <i>gimbap,</i>
fish cakes, and <i>sundae</i> with the entrails.

61
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,625
{\an8}Can I have one?

62
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,210
{\an8}Come more often!

63
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,586
{\an8}- Okay?
- I'm here!

64
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,005
{\an8}I'm just happy to see you.

65
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,175
{\an8}You get prettier by the day.

66
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,468
{\an8}I was always pretty.

67
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,555
{\an8}- Are you just getting off work?
- My goodness.

68
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,726
{\an8}We don't have a show today.
What brings you here?

69
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,561
{\an8}Well…

70
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,105
{\an8}Oh, my.

71
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,898
{\an8}Don't tell me…

72
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,818
{\an8}Did you come hoping to run into me?

73
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,945
{\an8}Come on.

74
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,697
{\an8}We're visiting a site together
in a few days!

75
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,207
I was kidding.

76
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,044
Do you live in Yeouido?

77
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,547
Yeah, it's near the hospital.

78
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,633
Thank you.

79
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,804
Is it…

80
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,306
your birthday today?

81
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,600
- What?
- That looks like a feast.

82
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,104
This is one serving for me.

83
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,439
I see.

84
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,986
That day at the French restaurant,
it didn't even make a dent in my stomach.

85
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,737
Eat up.

86
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,373
Hey.

87
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,085
Interpreter Hong Hee-joo.

88
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,087
It's her, isn't it?

89
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,047
Your secret crush.

90
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,848
I could just tell that day.

91
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,351
You said you've been through
unrequited love like a fan before.

92
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,352
Remember?

93
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,440
Well… I'm curious about something too.

94
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,733
Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon.

95
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,569
Why are you such a big fan of him?

96
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,489
Well…

97
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,365
Me?

98
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,411
I didn't like him at first.

99
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,373
Actually, I was so scared of him.

100
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,458
ON AIR

101
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,504
Are you saying there are no standards
to regulate microplastics?

102
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:29,050
{\an8}Yes, a bill must be prepared
through National Assembly discussions.

103
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,969
{\an8}That's all that I've prepared.

104
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,390
{\an8}Then, what could be
realistic regulatory measures?

105
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,392
Excuse me?

106
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,145
MICROPLASTIC SWALLOWING THE OCEAN

107
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,063
Well…

108
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,818
First, we should reduce plastic use
and use tumblers instead of disposables.

109
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,531
That would be more of an individual effort
and a recommendation.

110
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,076
What could be legally prohibited?

111
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,452
Well…

112
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,372
Well…

113
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,416
Anchor Na You-ri?

114
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,919
Aside from just raising the issue,

115
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,880
are there no concrete solutions prepared?

116
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,011
Well… I…

117
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,181
He's breaking in a new recruit again.

118
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,475
She looks like she'll cry.

119
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,480
Thank you for your presentation.

120
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,415
Come in by two o'clock from tomorrow.

121
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,002
You mean, two o'clock in the morning?

122
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:52,133
If you're to run it by me for review,
learn how to write it, and practice,

123
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,843
it's not that early.

124
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,972
You'll teach me yourself?

125
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,561
An anchor isn't a parrot
that simply reads off a script.

126
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,733
Plus, for the morning news, you should
come in by two to remove facial swelling.

127
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,487
Look at your face now.
You look like a soggy steamed bun.

128
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,831
He was scary,

129
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,418
but he was a good colleague
who taught me a lot.

130
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,964
But then one day,

131
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,800
he quit his job
and got appointed as spokesperson.

132
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,093
He even got married.

133
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,513
- Now it's hard to see him once a year.
- Who did he marry?

134
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,948
Sa-eon's family
is a famous political family.

135
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,577
His grandfather's a bigwig who's done
everything except for the presidency.

136
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,454
His father's
a strong presidential candidate.

137
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,748
His relatives are
former or current ministers,

138
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,500
prosecutor generals, mayors, lawmakers…

139
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,586
Naturally, he married the daughter
of a very influential family.

140
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,424
The eldest daughter of Chairman Hong
of Chungwoon Daily News.

141
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,733
Did you just remember
what day it is today?

142
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,283
<i>Why a hotel room?</i>

143
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,452
Wash your face. And blow your nose too.

144
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,839
<i>Yes, this is room service.</i>

145
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,694
<i>I need to get it together.</i>

146
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>I have to stay focused from now on.</i>

147
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,293
Should we talk now?

148
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,086
Sit down.

149
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,966
Take out your phone.

150
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,343
Because from now on,

151
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,804
I want us to have a conversation.

152
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,100
<i>- Not an interrogation?</i>
- It's not an interrogation.

153
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,270
As you know,

154
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,024
someone's been messing with us lately.

155
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,110
Your car, my office,

156
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,613
and even your father's nursing home
this time.

157
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,324
I haven't requested
a police investigation yet.

158
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,534
But if this continues,

159
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,703
I'll have no other choice.

160
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,545
If you're the victim instead of me,
the police will start digging into you.

161
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,133
So before that happens,
tell me if you're hiding anything.

162
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,391
I guess there is something.

163
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,610
I could keep pressuring you
until I force it out of you, but…

164
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,321
I won't.

165
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,324
I won't do that, Hee-joo.

166
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,452
We're not close enough to interfere

167
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,372
with each other's lives, right?

168
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,379
Leave it at the door.

169
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,816
Eat this and rest.
Come down afterward. I'll go first.

170
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,412
You haven't settled from the shock yet.

171
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,541
You know you'll be very tense down there.

172
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,754
Don't overdo it. Just do as I say.

173
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,635
Another glass.

174
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,982
Relax.

175
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,443
What?

176
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,616
Ouch.

177
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,370
Do you have a plan?

178
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,170
It shouldn't just be
another regular meal today, right?

179
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,215
Didn't the aides make a plan?

180
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,300
I don't need a grand plan for this.

181
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,053
A disobedient child?

182
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,888
Just beat him until he obeys.

183
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,724
Don't worry.

184
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,375
You're here.

185
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,713
Why are you alone?

186
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,339
Where is she?

187
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,926
She's not feeling well.

188
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,927
Call her.

189
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,182
Did you not hear me?

190
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,518
Bring her here right now.

191
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,978
Let's eat.

192
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,856
I only have an hour to spare.

193
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,651
Didn't you have something to say to me?

194
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,810
Appear on a show?

195
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,728
Yeah.

196
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,857
A special on presidential candidates.
Just anyone does it these days.

197
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,611
You know, cooking, dancing, and singing.

198
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,324
Come when we're filming.

199
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,876
Come and sit.

200
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,597
Others bring their sons, daughters-in-law,

201
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,434
and even their dogs and cats
to promote themselves.

202
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,728
But our family…

203
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,148
The only thing I can boast about
is my son.

204
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,611
Have you still not heard from your sister?

205
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,154
Don't bring that up again.

206
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,324
You know, I really think
Chairman Hong tricked me.

207
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,828
He never intended to give us
his eldest daughter in the first place.

208
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,163
Right? He's so skeptical.

209
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,833
He's scared I might lose the election.

210
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,752
That's why he sent
his flawed daughter as a stand-in.

211
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,506
What exactly is your purpose?

212
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,385
Even if you were a bargain,
you should be able to earn your keep.

213
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,971
Why can't you do anything?

214
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,435
What are you doing?

215
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,646
It's rude. We're eating.

216
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,606
Bring it.

217
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,955
Welcome.

218
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,418
There's a paparazzi
taking pictures of guests here.

219
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,009
"Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon meets with
his father, Paik Ui-yong, for dinner."

220
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,887
"Will he join the election campaign?"

221
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,431
Is that the headline you wanted?

222
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,603
I'll decide whether or not to participate
in your election.

223
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,105
Coercion, threats, subtle manipulation.

224
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,523
Don't even think of it.

225
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,652
You little punk.

226
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,295
You arrogant brat.

227
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,466
You punk.

228
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,385
Do you know what will happen
if you keep acting like this?

229
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,932
The moment you step out of my shadow,
you could get crushed completely.

230
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,977
Do you really think I'm still in there?

231
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,145
What did you say?

232
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,024
Wait.

233
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,693
It's not you, is it?

234
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,694
What do you mean?

235
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,073
I know you'd do anything
to get me to surrender.

236
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,826
- So the thought crossed my mind.
- What are you talking about?

237
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,161
Make some damn sense!

238
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,875
I'll say one thing.

239
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,671
You're at the threshold
of being president, thanks to Grandfather.

240
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,132
The least you could do
is step over it on your own.

241
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,759
Don't whine

242
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,011
and ask me to push you.

243
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,222
What?

244
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,852
- Are you done?
- I am.

245
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,898
And I'll leave now.

246
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,907
Was this your plan?

247
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,243
You ruined everything.

248
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,122
That punk started it!

249
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,208
Damn it.

250
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,460
That damned punk.

251
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,558
I bet you…

252
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,893
want to divorce me.

253
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,815
You married me in place
of your missing sister and can't speak.

254
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,110
So you can't even defend yourself
when your in-laws spout nonsense.

255
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,994
They're people
who can easily replace their children.

256
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,912
So whatever they say,

257
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,875
don't listen to them or take it to heart.

258
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,386
PARK DO-JAE

259
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,306
Go inside.

260
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,191
Yes, go ahead.

261
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,945
The detective in charge
of the nursing home incident just called.

262
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,324
He said the blood analysis results
confirmed animal blood and fake teeth.

263
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,575
Animal?

264
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,831
Okay.

265
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,585
Also, I have a personal request.

266
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,263
<i>Call…</i>

267
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,724
Call him.

268
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,770
Sis.

269
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,733
<i>No backing out in the middle.</i>

270
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,402
<i>You started this,</i>

271
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,905
<i>so you see it through.</i>

272
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,281
<i>Got it?</i>

273
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,827
<i>Sis!</i>

274
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,789
<i>I can't…</i>

275
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,333
<i>do this anymore.</i>

276
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,227
Where are you going?

277
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,356
Is that trash?

278
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,441
Give it to me.

279
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,529
I'll take it out.

280
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,423
{\an8}DIRECTOR HAN JIN-E

281
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,551
<i>- Hey, Hee-joo!</i>
<i>- Hee-joo!</i>

282
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,888
<i>You can do this! Good luck! You got this!</i>

283
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,889
<i>Good luck!</i>

284
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:34,848
<i>Let's go!</i>

285
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,850
<i>To the president's office!</i>

286
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,769
{\an8}<i>Thanks, everyone.</i>

287
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,104
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

288
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,106
<i>Dinner's on you if you pass!</i>

289
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,774
<i>Good luck! We love you!</i>

290
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,570
I'll wish you luck too.

291
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,946
You'll pass.

292
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,998
<i>If I get it, what then?</i>

293
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,543
What do you mean?

294
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,880
<i>We talked about this before.</i>

295
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,883
<i>If our families find out</i>
<i>I'm working beside you…</i>

296
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,134
Hong Hee-joo.

297
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,055
How much longer
will you live as the obedient child?

298
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,849
Aren't you sick of others
telling you what to do?

299
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,894
It's your chance to try
with your name on the line.

300
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,856
Chicken out and blow it
or give up over what others think.

301
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,816
Do whatever you want.

302
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,079
<i>Okay, then you should start thinking about</i>

303
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,332
<i>how you're going to handle</i>
<i>the aftermath if I get the job.</i>

304
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,855
PARK DO-JAE

305
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,402
<i>I looked into what you asked for.</i>

306
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,031
{\an8}CLASSY COUNTY
WE MEET ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER TODAY

307
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,747
<i>Looks good. Let's go with this.</i>

308
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,434
Our spokesperson has never been this late
to work before.

309
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,977
Is something wrong?

310
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,563
He has matters to take care of,
so he'll be late.

311
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,779
- Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,373
- I have something to report.
- Me too.

313
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,625
It's urgent. I'll go first.

314
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,710
Mine's urgent too.

315
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,046
Mr. Park.

316
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,047
Yes, sir.

317
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,353
I'm the section chief.

318
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,441
I have something to discuss
regarding the voice modulation.

319
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,692
Did you find something?

320
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,070
If we analyze
the waveform and spectrogram,

321
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,907
I think we'll be able to determine
the pitch range, age, and gender.

322
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,283
We don't need the gender.

323
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,453
To be honest, I'm not curious
about that pervert's voice.

324
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,581
Just in case, it might be someone I know.

325
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,583
- That's why I want to unmask him.
- Okay.

326
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,460
I'll report it as soon as it's done.

327
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,795
Okay.

328
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,297
And this is regarding Ji Sang-woo.

329
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,926
A lot of his videos

330
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,804
are about unsolved cases
related to arson and bombs.

331
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,349
He seems to be very knowledgeable
about explosions and arson methods.

332
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,727
And currently,
he's appearing on HBC's <i>Crime Report.</i>

333
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,979
It's a mystery crime program.

334
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,399
"Crime Report"?

335
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,654
Okay.

336
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,155
- You're excused.
- Yes, sir.

337
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,999
Sir.

338
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,670
It's the final interview list
for the sign language interpreters.

339
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,589
{\an8}HONG HEE-JOO

340
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,634
The interviews will start soon.
Will you join?

341
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,727
CANDIDATE ID
HONG HEE-JOO

342
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,480
<i>It's your chance to try</i>
<i>with your name on the line.</i>

343
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,442
Chicken out and blow it
or give up over what others think.

344
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,652
Do whatever you want.

345
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,788
Candidate 24, 25, and 26, please be ready.

346

{\an8}2024 PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER INTERVIEW

347
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,760
You'll conduct a real briefing
for the final interview.

348
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,261
It'll be a practical exam.

349
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,096
In case of real-time interpretation,

350
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,725
quick thinking and sign language speed
are especially important.

351
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,019
{\an8}I'll play an existing briefing video.

352
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,103
{\an8}Candidate…

353
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,648
{\an8}number 24, Hong Hee-joo,
we'll start with you.

354
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,199
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE

355
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>The 2020 Korea-Egypt summit briefing.</i>

356
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,710
<i>Korea and Egypt</i>
<i>have complementary industrial structures,</i>

357
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,047
<i>which offer great potential</i>
<i>for expanding trade and investment.</i>

358
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,964
<i>It is hoped that</i>

359
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,134
<i>the Korea-Egypt Trade and Economic</i>
<i>Partnership Joint Research MOU</i>

360
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,512
<i>will lead to an FTA</i>
<i>between the two countries.</i>

361
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,807
<i>Also, it was expressed that there's hope</i>
<i>for cooperative projects</i>

362
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,017
<i>to strengthen administrative capabilities</i>

363
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,895
<i>by sharing South Korea's</i>
<i>digital information expertise.</i>

364
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,815
<i>Furthermore, both countries agreed</i>
<i>to open a new chapter</i>

365
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,568
<i>of mutually beneficial cooperation</i>
<i>in key areas such as economic investment,</i>

366
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,112
<i>cultural heritage preservation</i>
<i>and management,</i>

367
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,282
<i>energy, advanced technologies,</i>
<i>and defense,</i>

368
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,118
<i>aiming to establish</i>
<i>a comprehensive partnership</i>

369
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,037
<i>between the two nations.</i>

370
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,624
<i>As emphasized, this will boost</i>
<i>our country's overall competitiveness.</i>

371
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,209
Thank you.

372
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:40,964
Excuse me.

373
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,259
Yes?

374
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,637
I understand.

375
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,434
SPOKESPERSON BRIEFING

376
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,428
Candidate number 24,
interpreter Hong Hee-joo.

377
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,140
I want you to answer
the questions I ask honestly.

378
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,269
Did you know the script in advance?

379
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,479
It wasn't simultaneous interpretation.

380
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,983
I noticed that you signed
before I even spoke sometimes.

381
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,068
How will you explain this?

382
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,864
I practiced to these videos.

383
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,992
If that's the case,

384
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,787
can we test you with a different video?

385
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,331
Yes.

386
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,303
<i>For a healthy society,</i>

387
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:15,600
<i>all citizens must unite</i>
<i>in caring for and educating children.</i>

388
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:19,812
<i>This is something that all members</i>
<i>of society must participate in.</i>

389
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,772
Enough.

390
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,023
Next video.

391
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,652
<i>Our government has consistently expressed</i>
<i>its willingness</i>

392
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,862
<i>to engage in dialogue</i>
<i>to resolve the issue.</i>

393
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,364
- Next.
<i>- Diplomatic communication…</i>

394
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,701
<i>In the current situation where</i>
<i>business leaders are facing difficulties</i>

395
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,372
<i>and everyone is trying their best</i>
<i>in their respective positions,</i>

396
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,499
<i>- we must answer what truly…</i>
- Next.

397
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>…serves the people…</i>

398
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,920
<i>To prevent further harm</i>
<i>to the victim's reputation</i>

399
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,882
<i>through reports where even the facts</i>
<i>have not been verified,</i>

400
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,385
<i>I ask that journalists exercise caution.</i>

401
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,138
Did you practice to all of these?

402
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,517
Yes.

403
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,647
It'll be the same
with any other video you play.

404
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,067
Why have you memorized all the videos?

405
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,989
I practiced a lot with your videos.

406
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,909
They were chosen at random,
regardless of the year or content.

407
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,371
But your hands move at the same speed
and timing as my voice.

408
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,416
Is that a coincidence?
It's not just once or twice.

409
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,294
Interpreter Hong Hee-joo,
answer my question.

410
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,727
What did you just say?

411
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,230
Interpreter Hong Hee-joo!

412
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,363
I said I did it because I was crazy.

413
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,531
Wow.

414
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,532
She was crazy.

415
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,706
I was obsessed
with your briefings, Mr. Paik.

416
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,461
<i>I've dreamed of becoming a sign language</i>
<i>interpreter for a government agency.</i>

417
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,129
<i>That became excessive…</i>

418
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,465
This is the result of intense practicing?

419
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,468
{\an8}<i>How your upper lip and upper teeth move</i>

420
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,597
{\an8}<i>when you set your articulation points,</i>
<i>I studied that a lot in particular.</i>

421
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,931
<i>I can predict consonants</i>

422
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,101
<i>from the sounds your tongue makes</i>
<i>against the roof of your mouth.</i>

423
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,479
So, as soon as I open my mouth…

424
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,396
No, wait.

425
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,025
Your hands move faster
when you predict it?

426
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,195
And you studied it that obsessively?

427
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:36,783
<i>I mimicked, practiced, and dug into it.</i>

428
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,372
But…

429
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,084
can you not speak at all?

430
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,799
Personal disabilities
aren't disqualifying factors,

431
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,634
so she passed the document review.

432
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,889
And the job of an interpreter is to listen
and convey it with their hands, so…

433
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,808
If you get the job,

434
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,478
how will you communicate
with the spokesperson's team?

435
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:19,367
{\an8}2024 PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER INTERVIEW

436
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,579
<i>I don't know why, but he's fixated.</i>

437
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,289
<i>It might take a while.</i>

438
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,960
The interview is running behind.

439
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,670
I hope you understand.

440
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,222
Can you use sign language?

441
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,766
<i>If you can't, I'll teach you.</i>

442
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,768
<i>You need to learn so you can see</i>

443
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,813
<i>whether we interpreters are conveying</i>
<i>your message properly.</i>

444
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,358
<i>If the nuance is off,</i>
<i>you can correct it right away.</i>

445
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,277
<i>Sign language isn't difficult.</i>

446
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,698
<i>If you learn it, there won't be issues</i>
<i>communicating with me either.</i>

447
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,284
You're right. That's a good idea.

448
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,582
We'll discuss that if you get the job.

449
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,375
Finally,

450
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,669
I want to test you on something.

451
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,797
I'll read a document
that you've never seen before,

452
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,382
on the spot.

453
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,801
Can you do it?

454
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,053
Yes.

455
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,931
Then, let's begin.

456
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,146
Couple's Day…

457
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,192
is a national observance
established to remind us

458
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,070
of the importance of marital relationships
and to encourage

459
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,906
the building of harmonious families.

460
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,618
There's a couple here now.

461
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,291
The two have lived
without being able to open up

462
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,418
to each other.

463
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,216
Would things have been different…

464
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,803
if they had been more honest

465
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,598
and shown their true feelings?

466
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,102
If they try to make an effort now,

467
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,607
could they live
like any other ordinary couple?

468
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,903
Yet again today,

469
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,280
like how a mind game is played,

470
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,533
the couple merely tries to read
each other's minds.

471
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,827
The ironic thing is that

472
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,832
their behavior is surprisingly similar.

473
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,022
That's enough.

474
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,191
Let's stop here.

475
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,716
<i>I can assure you,</i>
<i>there's no one better than me.</i>

476
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,343
<i>I can tell by a person's expression.</i>

477
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,388
{\an8}<i>I know what you're going to say</i>
<i>and what you're thinking.</i>

478
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,352
<i>I mimicked, practiced, and dug into it.</i>

479
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,106
Hong Hee-joo.

480
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,901
What are you…

00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,928
<i>Well done.</i>

484
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,387
Classy County?

485
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,641
We should move him
to a different nursing home.

486
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,270
<i>- …work this much?</i>
<i>- Tell me about it.</i>

487
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,731
<i>He's an anchor.</i>

488
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,900
<i>You weren't a farmer?</i>

489
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,195
{\an8}<i>That'll be hard in old age too.</i>

490
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,279
{\an8}<i>So true.</i>

491
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,451
Ta-da.

492
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,995
Dried persimmons. Your favorite.

493
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,330
Yeah, they're good.

494
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,792
- They're from Sangju.
- Yeah.

495
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,921
Dad, do you like it here?

496
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,381
Tastes good.

497
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,844
It's much nicer than before, right?

498
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,306
Dad?

499
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,017
I'm sorry.

500
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,854
That will never happen again.

501
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,938
Don't worry, okay?

502
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,710
Dad, who did--

503
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,128
"Don't worry, Father."

504
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:09,175
"No matter what happens,
I'll protect you and Hee-joo."

505
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,227
He came here?

506
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,285
Warm, right?

507
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,583
So warm, yet so cold.

508
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,878
So harsh, yet so kind.

509
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,299
I can't figure him out.

510
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,136
I thought I knew him well,

511
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,097
but I don't think I do at all.

512
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,359
Today's sign language interpreter
interview evaluation.

513
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,861
Is the press release ready?

514
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,987
It's being finalized.

515
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,323
By the way,

516
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,327
about interpreter Hong Hee-joo
who had an interview earlier,

517
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,331
were you pleased with her or not?

518
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,208
Why do you want to know that?

519
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,125
Excuse me?

520
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,461
Because…

521
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:35,010
Everyone found out
you turned the interview room upside down,

522
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,346
so we made a bet for fun…

523
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,556
A bet?

524
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,807
For fun?

525
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,893
We were about to, but we decided not to,
and we won't.

526
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,145
What? A bet? No way.

527
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,023
In this crucial decision
to select an interpreter

528
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,025
to be the voice of our office…

529
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,992
By the way, I like her.

530
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,372
Interpreter Hong Hee-joo,
who studied you so passionately.

531
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:10,838
So do I.

532
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,341
I like her.

533
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,468
Pardon?

534
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,111
HONG HEE-JOO

535
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,036
Congratulations.

536
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,495
Thank you.

537
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,452
You didn't eat anything.

538
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:27,289
Not eating as an invited guest
is considered disrespectful.

539
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,750
Eat it.

540
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,545
My son…

541
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,799
likes fish.

542
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,574
Stop stuffing your face!

543
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,911
I didn't eat anything yet.

544
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,206
I told you not to act pathetic.

545
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,044
Learn from your sister.

546
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,438
Let's switch.

547
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:36,900
Eat it.

548
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,042
Slow down.

549
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,089
What's your name?

550
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:05,888
"Hong."

551
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:07,848
"Hee."

552
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,809
"Joo."

553
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:11,727
HONG HEE-JOO

554
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,395
<i>"Hong Hee-joo"?</i>

555
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,657
When did you grow up so much?

556
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,793
<i>Thank you.</i>

557
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,963
<i>You changed my dad's nursing home.</i>

558
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,386
He read it right away.

559
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,901
{\an8}HONG IN-A

560
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,128
{\an8}<i>What are you saying?</i>

561
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,340
{\an8}<i>You want me to go in In-a's place</i>
<i>at the wedding tomorrow?</i>

562
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,425
Have you ever imagined that, Hee-joo?

563
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,678
You and I come from humble beginnings,

564
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:31,306
and now we'll be
the future president's in-laws!

565
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,630
<i>Keep it safe.</i>

566
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,886
If the real owner returns,

567
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,180
you might have to give it back.

568
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,381
Start.

569
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,010
SA-EON

570
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,764
What? Right now? At this hour?

571
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,182
Why?

572
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,061
No, wait. Don't overthink it.
Just answer it.

573
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,068
Hello? Sa-eon?

574
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,320
<i>Hey, it's me. I only have three minutes.</i>

575
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,363
<i>I'll make it quick.</i>

576
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,405
Oh, my.

577
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,242
By chance, did you just add water
to your cup noodles too?

578
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,119
No, I'm driving.

579
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,288
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

580
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,998
Ji Sang-woo I met the other day.

581
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,958
- He's doing a program with you, right?
<i>- Yes.</i>

582
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,380
Age 34. Yeonhui University College
of Medicine, class of 2010.

583
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,132
Director of Bliss Care Clinic.
Do you know anything else about him?

584
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,053
Did you run a background check on him?

585
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,056
Do you know anything about him
that's not on the website?

586
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,516
I have two minutes left.

587
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,353
Well…

588
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,064
Right. He lives in Yeouido.

589
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,190
Near the HBC building.

590
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,234
- And.
- And?

591
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,569
And…

592
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,154
He grew up in an orphanage!

593
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:52,823
An orphanage?

594
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,075
<i>No! Never mind!</i>

595
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,121
NURI DREAM CENTER

596
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,332
Is it Nuri Dream Center?

597
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,168
Formerly known as Sinil Childcare Center?

598
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,837
How did you know?

599
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,424
But…

600
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,634
<i>why do you want to know?</i>

601
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,677
I'm out of time.

602
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,053
<i>Enjoy your noodles.</i>

603
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,983
It seems you messed up again, 406.

604
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,735
You asked me before,

605
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:34,197
what do I get in return
if you get rid of Hong Hee-joo?

606
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,284
<i>I'll answer that question.</i>

607
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,745
What is it?

608
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,205
Hong In-a.

609
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,507
<i>In-a needs a place to return to.</i>

610
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,011
<i>You and your family wanted</i>

611
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,472
Hong In-a from the start anyway.

612
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,806
Hong Hee-joo…

613
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,519
is just a stand-in puppet.

614
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,023
There.

615
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,276
So get rid of Hong Hee-joo.

616
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,654
Before Hong In-a returns
and complicates things,

617
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,658
- take care of Hong Hee-joo--
<i>- 406, you don't know anything.</i>

618
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,993
What?

619
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,498
I'll only say this once,
so listen carefully.

620
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,958
Before Hong In-a disappeared,

621
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,669
the last person she met with
before the wedding

622
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,754
<i>was me.</i>

623
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,466
What?

624
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,845
I guess you didn't dig that deep.

625
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,556
<i>When you two met,</i>

626
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,100
what did you talk about?

627
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,310
<i>We made a deal.</i>

628
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,021
<i>What deal?</i>

629
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,065
Because of that deal,

630
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:54,069
Hong In-a can never become
Paik Sa-eon's wife.

631
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,112
<i>What now?</i>

632
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,407
<i>I think I just got rid of</i>
<i>your motive for blackmail.</i>

633
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,706
He met with In-a?

634
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,126
They made a deal? What deal?

635
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,103
You're still up?

636
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:32,566
I thought you'd be sleeping
after the stressful day you had today.

637
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,613
I owe you an apology
for underestimating you.

638
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,199
You did great.

639
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,788
But the official results
haven't been announced yet.

640
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,498
So don't get ahead of yourself.

641
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:51,835
Also,

642
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,463
I'm attending the Chungwoon Daily News
anniversary event tomorrow.

643
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,679
<i>Why all of a sudden?</i>

644
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,515
<i>Do you know or not</i>

645
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,143
<i>that my sister is back?</i>

646
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,312
You look beautiful.

647
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,483
- Hello.
- Hi, so pretty.

648
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,569
You know what day it is today, right?

649
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,279
I want something special.

650
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,739
Hello.

651
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,326
Look who it is.

652
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,994
Hello.

653
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,913
Ms. Lee.

654
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,332
Can you have two clients
in one room like this?

655
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,084
I'm sorry. Show her to the waiting room.

656
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,341
We're a family.

657
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:44,804
You're always so busy.
I didn't think you'd make it to the event.

658
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,057
Just like last time,

659
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,226
I thought your husband
would be coming with a cute aide.

660
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,955
I want my hair to be higher than hers.

661
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,748
Make my eyeliner wings longer too!

662
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,670

00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,149
WITH THE PEOPLE
CHUNGWOON DAILY NEWS

667
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,069
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

668
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,866
We'll begin the cutting of the cake.

669
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,269
Congratulations.

670
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,814
I wish you infinite success
and development in the future.

671
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,691
Thank you so much.

672
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,569
You're the busiest man in our country,
yet you made it.

673
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,029
You flatter me.

674
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,823
We wouldn't miss
such a meaningful and joyous day.

675
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:29,951
But…

676
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,370
I don't see our spokesperson yet.

677
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:38,710
I wonder if the presidential office
is looking for a successor.

678
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,212
If he wants to join
the presidential campaign,

679
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,007
isn't it time he left his position?

680
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,341
Of course.

681
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,596
But as you know, he has so much ambition.

682
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,058
I'm not sure if he'll give up his career
and join me.

683
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:57,062
But still,
I'll try harder to convince him.

684
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,734
How delightful.

685
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,111
Yes, okay.

686
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,844
Hee-joo.

687
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,977
Come with me.

688
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,877
What's this about your dad?
The hospital called and said he was moved.

689
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,795
Is that true?

690
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,760
<i>Your son-in-law moved him.</i>

691
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,304
He did?

692
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,850
Are you telling me
he found out about your dad?

693
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,479
How could you let that happen?

694
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,148
What if the chairman finds out?

695
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,363
<i>Aren't you going to ask why he was moved</i>
<i>or what happened to him?</i>

696
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,824
I don't care.

697
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,494
Anyway, now that he's been moved,
I don't need to pay anymore, right?

698
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,044
That's much better.

699
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,550
Did you see Sa-eon?

700
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,136
He's in a whole different class now.

701
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,929
I know, right?

702
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,598
Is In-a not coming again today?

703
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,642
She hasn't shown her face in public
since she got married.

704
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,313
The president's daughter-in-law,
someone of great importance.

705
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,314
Such a big deal.

706
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,941
But In-a's sister is here.

707
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:10,820
- She's such an attention-seeker.
- I always found her a bit off.

708
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,823
She followed In-a around like a shadow.
So creepy.

709
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:17,160
- Another glass of wine?
- Shall we? Let's go.

710
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,077
Must be nice.

711
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,995
- Let's toast.
- Cheers.

712

PAIK SA-EON

713
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:22,952
PAIK SA-EON

714
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,740
406, Hong Hee-joo.

715
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,244
He must not care about either.

716
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,752
<i>Hello?</i>

717
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,216
<i>Speak.</i>

718
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,810
Your fiancée disappeared

719
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,979
the day before the wedding,

720
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,067
and Hong Hee-joo stepped in instead.

721
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,905
How did you feel?

722
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,494
Well, I get it.

723
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,287
I'm sure it wasn't great.

724
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,625
<i>It was similar.</i>

725
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,298
Right.

726
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,219
What use is she? Who else would take her?

727
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,430
She's gloomy.

728
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,808
She has no social skills.

729
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,769
She's just…

730
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,900
the supplementary pages
that came with Hong In-a.

731
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,111
Yeah.

732
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,488
That's what she is.

733
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,783
Do you know what's funnier?

734
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,327
She always knew that too.

735
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,666
But she hesitated each time
even though she wanted to break free.

736
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,213
<i>She didn't have the courage.</i>

737
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,175
<i>She hated rich families</i>
<i>but was comforted by luxury.</i>

738
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,470
<i>She cowardly succumbed to money.</i>

739
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,441
Hello?

740
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,071
Hee-joo…

741
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,533
<i>isn't gloomy.</i>

742
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,787
She's observing her surroundings.

743
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,456
She doesn't lack social skills.

744
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,834
In general, people are rude to her first.

745
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,921
Also, she didn't succumb to money.

746
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:23,925
She just…

747
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,969
loved her mother.

748
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:31,849
<i>There was a time</i>

749
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:36,312
when I hated to eat or speak
with my mouth.

750
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:43,069
I was surrounded by greedy,
noisy, and bothersome people.

751
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,280
And she was the most quiet.

752
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,326
When I stared at her…

753
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,580
<i>strangely, I could breathe easily.</i>

754
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,294
What did you say?

755
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,171
Supplementary pages?

756
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,424
If you don't know, listen carefully, 406.

757
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,885
Hee-joo isn't supplementary pages.

758
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,762
She's a brand-new language.

759
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:14,433
She's repeated the same hand movements
thousands of times to become who she is.

760
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,769
People don't know that.

761
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,439
<i>So don't talk about my wife like that.</i>

762
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,278
Then why did you treat her
like she was invisible?

763
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,825
You say you know her so well,
then why did you do that?

764
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,954
Why did you tell her
not to think you were a couple?

765
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:19,457
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

766
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,208
Okay, I'll take it now.

767
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,044
One, two, three!

768
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,630
That was nice. One more.

769
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,049
Wait. Can I shake your hand?

770
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,550
Of course.

771
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,055
Okay. One, two, three!

772
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,017
Thank you so much.

773
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,561
It came out great.

774
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,397
My wife will love this.

775
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,482
Sure.

776
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:48,361
Then, the report…

777
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,320
That's right.

778
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:54,825
I almost forgot.

779
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,328
Is your wife okay?

780
01:05:58,579 --> 01:05:59,413
Thanks to you.

781
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,749
Thank you for your concern.

782
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,292
We're relieved to hear it.

783
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,253
She was so shocked that day.

784
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,839
I thought she was having a panic attack.

785
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,801
A panic attack?

786
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:12,927
Yes.

787
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,097
She was like…

788
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,264
Her face got so pale.

789
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,309
She was screaming so loudly too.

790
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,311
We were on the road then,

791
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,230
but I pulled over and let her out.

792
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,649
It would've been bad if we hadn't.

793
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,401
Wait.

794
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,904
What did you just say?

795
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,115
What?

796
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:36,993
Well…

797
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,580
- A panic…
- No, not that.

798
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,335
She screamed?

799
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,088
My wife did?

800
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,223
<i>What is it?</i>

801
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,141
<i>What's wrong?</i>

802
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,185
<i>- What…</i>
<i>- Are you feeling sick?</i>

803
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,981
<i>Let me out.</i>

804
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,860
Let me out.

805
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,696
We're on the road right now.

806
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:15,698
It'll be okay if you just let me out.

807
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,575
It'll be okay, so let me out!

808
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,493
Please, let me out!

809
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,101
<i>I can't do this. Just let me out.</i>

810
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,856
<i>Just let me out.</i>

811
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,614

1
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,722
Sir?

3
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,197
<i>Hello--</i>

4
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,169
It keeps disconnecting.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,004
Wait for now.

6
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:37,138
OFFICE BUILDING B

7
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,820
What?

8
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,238
What was that?

9
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,240
What? What's wrong?

10
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,077
- I think someone's here.
- Who? No one would come here.

11
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,167
See? I told you.

12
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:08,920
It's connected.

13
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,798
I'll stop it now.

14
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,050
Good job.

15
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,220
From now on, wait on all fours like that.

16
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,806
Who knows?

17
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,184
I might even throw you a bone.

18
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,480
What?

19
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,024
<i>What did you say, bastard?</i>

20
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,111
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>
<i>I really won't stand for this.</i>

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,113
Did someone order pizza?

22
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,573
But why is it so heavy?

23
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,366
<i>Don't regret this later.</i>

24
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:39,868
Don't open it!

25
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,255
Sir?

26
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,885
Sir.

27
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,348
Sir?

28
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,934
Sir!

29
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,147
Sir?

30
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,482
Are you okay?

31
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,155
You shouldn't get up.

32
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,077
What happened?

33
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,705
I brought you to Dr. Kim's hospital.

34
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,998
What about the others?

35
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,627
They're being treated in the ER.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured.

36
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,218
Was it an explosion?

37
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,678
Yes.

38
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,847
The police are analyzing the footage now.

39
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,390
But you need to see something.

40
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,143
It's from the security room.

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,937
I think it's him.

42
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,220
<i>At 10:49 p.m.,</i>
<i>Hong Hee-joo is safely at home.</i>

43
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,649
What will you do?
The police don't know you're involved.

44
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,068
So? Should I sit back and do nothing?

45
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,364
He broke into my personal office
and bombed my team.

46
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,366
He's trying to challenge me!

47
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,951
But if you get involved now,

48
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,203
the reporters will catch wind.

49
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,746
Maybe this is what he wants.

50
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,374
A situation where I can't step forward.

51
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,709
But…

52
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,336
I have to respond.

53
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,509
There are plenty of ways to screw him over
without revealing myself.

54
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,138
{\an8}EPISODE 3

55
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,891
{\an8}<i>The perpetrator,</i>
<i>who had been making threats,</i>

56
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,352
{\an8}<i>set fire</i>
<i>to the victim's office last night.</i>

57
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,021
{\an8}<i>- The fire department…</i>
- A fire?

58
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,856
{\an8}<i>…put out the fire in 20 minutes.</i>

59
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,150
{\an8}When did I do that?

60
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,321
{\an8}<i>There could've been casualties,</i>
<i>but quick action averted disaster.</i>

61
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,658
{\an8}<i>The police, fire department, and forensics</i>
<i>are conducting an investigation.</i>

62
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,620
{\an8}<i>They'll form a dedicated team</i>
<i>to look into the incident.</i>

63
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,372
{\an8}<i>This was Jang Seok-hyeon with HBC.</i>

64
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:44,886
Lately,

65
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,430
nothing makes sense.

66
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,976
There can't be a Hong Hee-joo
I don't know about.

67
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,523
I need to find out

68
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,650
which one is the real one.

69
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,904
Right now,

70
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,989
you're my only lead.

71
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,450
So cooperate.

72
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,263
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

73
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,394
Some crazy man
delivered a bomb to my personal office.

74
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,444
<i>- Was it the kidnapper?</i>
- Yeah.

75
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,074
From now on, I'll be asking the questions.

76
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,453
You said you didn't know
who he was, right?

77
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,165
Any guesses on who it is?

78
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,711
You don't know?

79
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,007
But why…

80
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,261
does it seem like…

81
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,557
he knows you so well?

82
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,524
Even your private…

83
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,026
<i>What do I say if he asks me</i>
<i>about the picture?</i>

84
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,571
…and intimate stories.

85
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,282
<i>Can things get more complicated from here?</i>

86
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,463
What are you doing?

87
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,679
<i>And what are you doing?</i>

88
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,521
<i>What does he know about me?</i>
<i>And what are you trying to check?</i>

89
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,322
<i>He kidnapped me,</i>
<i>and you got hurt because of him.</i>

90
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,324
<i>So, what are we doing right now?</i>

91
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,830
So…

92
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,584
you don't know what I'm trying to do

93
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,962
or what I'm trying to see, right?

94
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,514
PARK DO-JAE

95
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,074
I apologize if you were offended.

96
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,788
How did it go?

97
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,879
<i>I managed to get away with it.</i>

98
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,091
A serial arsonist?

99
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,426
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,556
In the last six months, there have been
multiple cases in the area.

101
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,267
The police are investigating this
as part of it.

102
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,062
Serial arson…

103
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,607
Either he's lucky or he planned this.

104
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,068
- It's one or the other.
<i>- What?</i>

105
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,656
He got lucky
without knowing about the serial arson,

106
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,576
or he intended
to ride the arsonist's coattails.

107
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,536
However,

108
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,079
it was probably intentional.

109
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,583
We'll investigate independently.

110
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,793
And there's something strange.

111
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>What is it?</i>

112
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,922
The explosion happened during the call.

113
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,258
Do you think there's an accomplice?

114
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,927
That seems possible.

115
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,847
<i>Yes, it's more than possible.</i>

116
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,808
The fact that he knows so much about me

117
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,686
suggests that he's very close.

118
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,648
The police are requesting
the threat recording. What shall I do?

119
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,066
It must not be leaked.

120
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,403
What I pieced together earlier
was for broadcasting purposes.

121
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,447
Tell them that's everything.

122
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,283
<i>Sa-eon edited it and handed it over?</i>

123
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,336
Bring your phone.
I have to check something.

124
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,922
I need to check for any signs of hacking.

125
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,356
How could you be so careless?

126
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,736
You earn a living with your hands.

127
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,662
It won't take long.

128
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,914
Are you going to the center?

129
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,709
Stay at home.

130
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,295
I have to leave after I shower.

131
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,965
<i>Hacking? Why?</i>

132
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,970
<i>Because of the photo?</i>

133
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,692
{\an8}MOVE TO TRASH

134
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,196
POWER OFF

135
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,516
The candidate registration is coming up.

136
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,811
You've never dropped out
of first place in the polls.

137
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,521
You can continue like this.

138
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,565
It's all thanks to you.

139
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,237
Our campaign's PR line for the election
is very solid.

140
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,155
I like it.

141
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,199
Thank you for getting me
such talented people.

142
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,826
Don't mention it.

143
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,663
But don't you actually keep

144
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,458
the most talented one close at hand?

145
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,376
My son-in-law.

146
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,795
Spokesperson Paik.

147
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,967
I wonder how you will use him
after you keep him hidden away.

148
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,594
I'm quite curious.

149
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,023
This reminds me of when I used
to go hunting with Chairman Paik.

150
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,611
He possessed
remarkable instinctive abilities.

151
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,614
I could never match
my father's athletic abilities.

152
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,202
He was decisive and made quick judgments.

153
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,956
It seems Sa-eon inherited those qualities.

154
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,722
This is so boring.

155
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,559
{\an8}We should tell them not to invite us
unless they're golfing.

156
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,477
Don't you agree?

157
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,317
Am I the only one who's bored?

158
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,779
What's so interesting?

159
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,489
That's hot!

160
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,366
- What's wrong, honey?
- What happened?

161
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,784
That's hot! I need ice!

162
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,536
- Ice!
- Get some ice!

163
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,620
I'll get the ice.

164
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,664
Did you make a mistake?

165
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,958
A mistake?

166
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,837
Would looking at someone else's phone
be accidental or intentional?

167
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,381
Come on.

168
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,593
Mr. Hong.

169
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,054
I'm sorry, but I'll get going.

170
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,014
I'm a bit sensitive to noise.

171
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,143
Ice. Bring it here.

172
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,104
Here you go.

173
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,022
You should sit down.

174
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,316
What do we do about this?

175
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,526
Let's see.

176
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,444
What if this leaves a scar?

177
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,575
I wouldn't have held back
if it weren't for you.

178
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,492
I see.

179
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,120
That's so cold.

180
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,941
OFFICE BUILDING FIRE IN YEOUIDO, SEOUL

181
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,446
Did you see it?

182
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,947
What do you think?

183
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,032
MASTER

184
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:12,912
DID YOU SEE IT? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

185
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,788
DON'T ACT ALONE FROM NOW ON.

186
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,501
<i>So why did you leave me out?</i>

187
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,254
{\an8}<i>I want to join in on the fun too.</i>

188
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,927
{\an8}Oh, a job?

189
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,013
{\an8}A college friend? Were you close?

190
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,604
SANG-WOO

191
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,611
{\an8}<i>Hee-joo, it was great to see you today.</i>

192
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,280
<i>I was reminded of old times,</i>
<i>so I looked this up. Remember?</i>

193
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,845
{\an8}NURI DREAM CENTER

194
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,686
{\an8}For <i>Crime Report: Season 2,</i>
we'll focus on unsolved cases.

195
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,482
Is there anything you haven't revealed yet
on your own channel?

196
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,403
Sir, do you really think
he'll reveal it on our show?

197
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:12,990
I do…

198
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,119
have one.

199
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,123
What is it?

200
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,669
Instead of asking what it is,

201
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,756
shouldn't you be asking
why I haven't revealed it yet?

202
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,217
Yeah, what is it
and why haven't you revealed it?

203
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,394
There's an orphanage
called Nuri Dream Center.

204
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,897
And I grew up there.

205
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,403
What?

206
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,031
First time seeing an orphan?

207
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,616
No.

208
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,161
Please continue.

209
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,581
So…

210
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,337
about 20 years ago, in the town
where the orphanage was located,

211
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,801
<i>there was an enormous mansion</i>
<i>owned by a wealthy family.</i>

212
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,249
<i>That's when I first met him.</i>

213
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,378
<i>The young master from Seoul</i>
<i>came to visit the mansion.</i>

214
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,718
<i>His room was filled</i>
<i>with all sorts of toys.</i>

215
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,390
<i>We played there joyfully every day.</i>

216
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,560
<i>Until the day…</i>

217
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,149
<i>I saw something terrible there.</i>

218
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,751
What was it?

219
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,336
What did you see?

220
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,590
Well…

221
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,095
Goodness!

222
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,557
The meeting's over.

223
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,102
I have plans for lunch.

224
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,646
- What?
- Excuse me.

225
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,564
What?

226
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,818
Did he just leave like that?

227
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,986
He just left?

228
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,615
NURI DREAM CENTER

229
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,369
NURI DREAM CENTER IS AN ORPHANAGE.

230
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,252
SANG-WOO

231
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,672
<i>Let's eat lunch here at noon</i>
<i>this Saturday if you have time.</i>

232
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,432
A cup of refreshing tea
to soothe an upset stomach.

233
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,310
- I'm on my way.
- Have a good day.

234
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,695
How refreshing.

235
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,783
The explosive device used is TATP,
a high-performance liquid explosive.

236
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,036
Despite its simple manufacturing,
it has immense explosive power.

237
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,915
Fortunately, the detonation device
wasn't fully activated in this incident.

238
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,168
Aren't the main ingredients
acetone and hydrogen peroxide?

239
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,338
That's right, so the police
are questioning nearby pharmacies.

240
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,176
What about the voice modulation?

241
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,219
Is it not done yet?

242
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,097
It's impossible to analyze
with existing software.

243
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,599
We're trying with a different version.
I apologize.

244
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,396
No, I'm sorry.

245
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,065
I'm asking for so much
over personal matters.

246
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,817
No, I just…

247
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,071
You entrusted me with this,
and I want to be of help.

248
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,325
Also, if there's someone threatening you,
it's my job to figure out who.

249
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,506
MATINÉE

250
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,142
<i>Sa-eon, I hope you have</i>
<i>a pleasant day today!</i>

251
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,436
<i>And enjoy your lunch!</i>

252
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,986
The seafood is great here.

253
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,363
Is white wine okay?

254
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,538
Na You-ri, reservation for two.

255
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,956
I'll show you to your table.

256
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,712
Do you have a private room here?

257
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,630
I'm afraid they're all full.

258
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,050
I see. What do I do?

259
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,968
A table in the open is uncomfortable.

260
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,262
What? Hey!

261
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,015
The interpreter!

262
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,101
You had plans with the interpreter?

263
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,021
Yes, we're friends from college.

264
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,190
Really?

265
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,651
I suddenly got plans to eat here too!

266
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,363
Right this way.

267
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,656
Okay.

268
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,076
Right.

269
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,911
By the way,

270
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,414
when my guest arrives later,

271
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,084
please try not to stare
too obviously, okay?

272
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,336
It could make him uncomfortable.

273
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,255
Well, enjoy your lunch.

274
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,095
What was that?

275
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,139
Is a celebrity coming?

276
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,855
Do I look puffy today?

277
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,028
Over here!

278
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,660
Isn't that…

279
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,747
<i>What? What's he doing here?</i>

280
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,083
<i>He won't act like he knows me, will he?</i>

281
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,879
<i>Don't.</i>

282
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:51,012
<i>- Please, don't.</i>
- Interpreter Hong Hee-joo?

283
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,356
There were no prints?

284
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,567
We checked the explosives, but nothing.

285
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,194
- What about local inquiries?
- We're still on it.

286
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,991
But which high-ranking official
in the presidential office

287
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,993
keeps requesting updates like this?

288
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:24,963
Goodness!

289
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,673
- Call 911!
- Someone call!

290
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,176
- Call 911.
- Okay.

291
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,719
- Evacuate everyone.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,220
- Bring a fire extinguisher.
- Okay.

293
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,343
Okay, okay.

294
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,886
Damn it!

295
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,738
Try this.
It's in season, so it'll be good.

296
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:37,869
{\an8}<i>It's good.</i>

297
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,788
Good, right?

298
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,249
Do you like it?

299
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:51,174
Hee-joo and Sang-woo are college friends.

300
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,929
It seems like you like seafood.

301
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,264
Yes, I do.

302
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:07,857
By the way, Sa-eon,
how do you know Hee-joo?

303
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,738
She recently helped us out
with interpreting at the British Embassy.

304
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,033
I was hoping to treat you
to a meal sometime.

305
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,493
I'm glad we met like this.

306
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,621
I'm sorry if I intruded.

307
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,039
No, it's fine.

308
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:27,460
Thanks to Hee-joo, I get to have lunch
with you, so it's an honor.

309
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,505
A glass of wine?

310
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,468
I don't day drink.

311
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,096
Right.

312
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,400
{\an8}Are you okay?

313
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,277
{\an8}We can go if you're uncomfortable.

314
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,154
I'm okay.

315
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,409
You're good at sign language.

316
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,452
Yes, I am.

317
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,120
- Are you an interpreter?
- No.

318
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,330
Then what do you do?

319
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,048
Mr. Ji is…

320
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,591
Mr. Ji? What does he do?

321
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,592
- He's a--
- A doctor.

322
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,846
- What department?
- Department of Psychiatry.

323
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,395
Are you married?

324
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,230
Are you interested in me?

325
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,482
Yes.

326
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,153
Are you okay?

327
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,159
<i>I have to use the restroom.</i>

328
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,495
Okay, go ahead.

329
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,225
Excuse me for a moment.

330
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,649
What an interesting person.

331
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,569
I must be his type.

332
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,154
Of course not!

333
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,782
He's a married man.

334
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,450
You caught him?

335
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,327
<i>Yes, he was apprehended at the scene.</i>

336
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,539
They searched his residence
and found plenty of homemade bombs.

337
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,706
It's not him.

338
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,543
- I think it's the neighborhood arsonist.
- Pardon?

339
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,795
If he was watching the fire at the scene,

340
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,840
he's likely a pyromaniac
who gets a thrill from it.

341
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,510
{\an8}So he's most likely the serial arsonist.

342
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,637
<i>Is he being interrogated now?</i>

343
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,555
Yes.

344
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,642
Man, you've got guts.

345
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,269
Set fire two days in a row?

346
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,729
I didn't do it yesterday.

347
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,313
You punk.

348
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,233
This is insane. I swear.

349
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:58,069
Why are you blaming me
and not catching that guy?

350
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,865
That bastard has no ethics.
How dare he do that in my turf?

351
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,992
Does that young brat
have nothing better to do?

352
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,243
"Young brat"?

353
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,414
Okay. I'm on my way now.

354
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,515
{\an8}<i>Why did you come here? How did you know?</i>

355
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,934
<i>You said you'd check for hacking.</i>
<i>Were you spying on me?</i>

356
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:30,852
Why?

357
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,188
Are you hiding something from me?

358
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,818
<i>What are you saying?</i>

359
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,821
<i>Do you suspect me and Sang-woo?</i>

360
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,823
"Suspect"?

361
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,825
About what?

362
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,371
<i>Whatever it is.</i>
<i>Sang-woo isn't that type of person. So--</i>

363
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,709
Do you know him that well?

364
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,377
A college friend?

365
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,297
You said he was a good person.

366
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,466
I don't know.

367
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,384
I don't care about that.

368
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,889
To me, he's just some loser
who suddenly showed up around you.

369
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:08,890
Also…

370
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,310
if you know him so well,

371
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,646
what about me?

372
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,940
How much do you know about me?

373
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,775
Haven't we known each other

374
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,236
for about 20 years now?

375
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,453
Hong Hee-joo.

376
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,248
Tell me.

377
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,792
Do you know me well?

378
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,586
I suddenly had this thought.

379
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,881
I thought I knew you too.

380
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,342
But I don't think…

381
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,096
I knew you all that well after all.

382
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,736
DIRECTOR HAN JIN-E

383
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,115
<i>I need to talk to you. Come to the center.</i>

384
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,664
Excuse me, I have to go now.

385
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,833
- I'll pay.
- No, I'll get it.

386
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,418
Can I get your business card?

387
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,463
Sure.

388
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,135
Come if you ever need counseling
or feel any discomfort.

391
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,982
- I'll see you again.
- Okay, Sa-eon.

392
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,234
Thanks for lunch!

393
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,996
{\an8}<i>Sorry, but the center called me.</i>
<i>I have to go.</i>

394
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,414
Okay. You should go.

395
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,344
<i>Good luck, Hong Hee-joo!</i>
<i>You can do it, Hong Hee-joo!</i>

396
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,346
<i>You got this, Hong Hee-joo!</i>

397

2024 PRESIDENTIAL
SIGN LANGUAGE INT. HIRING

398
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,265
I knew it.

399
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,184
I knew you'd like it.

400
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,311
{\an8}<i>I don't like it.</i>

401
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,896
Why not?

402
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:24,400
I know you've practiced signing
with Paik Sa-eon's videos every day.

403
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,487
Are you nervous about living out
your fangirl dreams?

404
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,074
{\an8}<i>Is it better after a divorce?</i>

405
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:32,909
What? Divorce?

406
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,328
Why? Why do you ask?

407
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,246
Is your husband having an affair?

408
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,293
{\an8}<i>I think my husband wishes I were dead.</i>

409
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,378
What?

410
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,965
My goodness. You had me there.

411
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,802
Hee-joo.

412
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,014
Did he tell you he wishes you were dead?

413
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,599
That means

414
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:02,313
he still really, really loves you deeply.

415
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,694
Hey.

416
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,407
When a couple truly separates,
they don't engage in heated arguments

417
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,993
or say things like,
"I wish you were dead."

418
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,872
They become indifferent
and walk back and forth saying,

419
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,501
"Are you not dead yet?"

420
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,925
Call me when there's a corpse.

421
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,515
{\an8}<i>It's a good reason…</i>

422
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,976
{\an8}<i>for divorce.</i>

423
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,649
You were right.

424
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,943
The man caught earlier was the arsonist.

425
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,990
But there was a small fire in the area
that wasn't reported to the police.

426
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,499
<i>The explosion killed some stray cats.</i>

427
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,834
Damn it.

428
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,270
You think it was done as a test?

429
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,022
Yes.

430
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,901
According to the arsonist, those were
the only two things he didn't do.

431
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,320
The park and our office building.

432
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:38,034
If he did that to animals,
he could have psychopathic tendencies.

433
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,537
How will you handle the call tonight?

434
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,667
We threw the bait,
so let's see how he reacts.

435
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,088
I've reset the equipment
in the new office.

436
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,215
Okay.

437
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,177
Also, look into this person.

438
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,639
Ji Sang-woo?

439
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,392
Do you know him?

440
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,895
{\an8}<i>Hello, Paradisers.</i>

<i>with a cup of tea.</i>

443
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,778
<i>- When you see a psychiatrist…</i>
- "Paradisers"? What?

444
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,447
It's a play on words with his name.

445
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,117
That's why his channel is called
"Earthly Paradise."

446
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,244
So he calls his viewers "Paradisers."

447
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,830
- Jeez.
- He has over 200,000 subscribers.

448
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,999
He mainly covers unsolved mystery cases
and criminal psychology.

449
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,043
- He's very popular among women.
- Why?

450
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,964
- Excuse me?
- Why is he popular among women?

451
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,925
I think…

452
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,302
it's his physique.

453
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,263
His physique?

454
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,311
He's serious about working out.

455
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,939
Especially the shoulder deltoids.
They're a work of art.

456
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,911
It seems this doctor
has a lot of free time.

457
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,747
And it seems, Mr. Park,

458
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,542
you do too.

459
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,590
What should I look for?
Do you have specific concerns?

460
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,468
It won't be too much to suspect anyone
who comes into view.

461
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,095
Find everything you can on him.

462
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,139
Yes, sir.

463
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,069
<i>If you're seriously thinking</i>

465
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,282
You think it's easy for women
to earn a living alone?

466
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,119
Experience as a sign language interpreter

467

How does it feel

484
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,861
So why did you drag your feet?

485
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,029
It's your fault
for taking my threat lightly.

486

Man, let's end this.

I want to ask you something first.

489
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,623
What do you gain if I leave Hong Hee-joo?

490
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,335
What do I gain?

491
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,299
<i>What 406 gains from this?</i>

492
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,183
What are you trying to achieve
by getting me to divorce Hong Hee-joo?

493
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
What do you mean?

494
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,187
It's not like you married her for love.

495
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,688
You don't even love her now.

496
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,400
If it's going to be like that,
just leave her.

497
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,825
Hello?

498
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,287
<i>I guess you have no idea</i>
<i>how that sounds to me.</i>

499
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,540
It feels like

500
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,877
your threats are
for someone else's benefit.

501
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,507
What's your relationship
with Hong Hee-joo?

502
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,554
Listen carefully, 406.

503
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,808
I will never give you what you want.

504
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,604
You're a crazy man
resorting to kidnapping, extortion,

505
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,231
and even bomb threats now.

506
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,483
Do you think I'd give Hee-joo to you?

507
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,444
I have no intention

508
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,738
of giving her up.

509
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,615
Wait, why won't you give her up--

510
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,409
I'm sorry. Let's end the call here
for today.

511
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,579
Hee-joo's waiting for something.

512
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,709
Hello?

513
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,131
What on earth…

514
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,845
What's he thinking?

515
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,396
I won't divorce you.

516
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:51,902
I'm saying this
just in case someone misleads you.

517
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,405
There's no divorce for me.

518
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,323
Whether it's a scandal or rumor,

519
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,326
I won't tolerate my name
being dragged through the mud.

520
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,249
<i>That's why.</i>

521
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,800
Everything you do…

522
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,725
is clumsy.

523
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,108
Did the official document
reach the center?

524
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,903
You're going to have to give it your all
to stand beside me.

525
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,503
<i>Why do you want me by your side?</i>

526
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,762
<i>If I become the interpreter</i>
<i>at the presidential office,</i>

527
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,347
<i>you think you can handle it?</i>

528
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,767
<i>The entire world will know</i>
<i>my name and face.</i>

529
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,811
You seem pretty confident, don't you?

530
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,233
<i>I can assure you,</i>
<i>there's no one better than me.</i>

531
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,322
What unfounded confidence is that?
You're not that experienced.

532
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,786
{\an8}<i>Experience isn't everything.</i>
<i>I can tell by a person's expression.</i>

533
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,830
<i>I know what you're going to say</i>
<i>and what you're thinking.</i>

534
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:31,919
Really?

535
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,504
Then tell me.

536
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,383
What am I thinking now?

537
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,971
The guy who kidnapped you and threw
a bomb in my office knows a lot,

538
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,015
as I mentioned, right?

539
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,393
Yes.

540
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,854
It's true we may be better off
as strangers,

541
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,773
but I hate that.

542
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,984
I don't like that what he said is true.

543
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,237
I want to tell him,

544
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,657
"No, you're wrong."

545
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,410
"What do you know about us?"

546
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,788
That's what I'll do.

547
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:23,846
Lie down.

548
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,475
Come and lie down.

549
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,019
I won't bite.

550
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,528
Do whatever you want.

551
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,460
What? Are you afraid I'll jump you?

552
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,421
Dream on.

553
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,340
If I were going to,
I'd have done it already.

554
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,050
We've been together for years.

555
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,264
Wait.

556
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,892
Are you scared you might jump me?

557
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,395
Yeah, I could see that happening.

558
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,316
Don't come if you can't resist.

559
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,425
Don't turn your back.

560
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,886
It's rude to the person beside you.

561
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,026
He knew where my office was,

562
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,739
so the house probably isn't safe either.

563
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,158
But for tonight…

564
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,745
sleep without worrying.

565
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,837
And whatever happened
the day you were kidnapped…

566
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,968
just think of it as a bad dream.

567
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,354
What you heard then, too.

568
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:44,319
<i>That you said to call</i>
<i>when there's a corpse?</i>

569
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,404
Forget it all.

570
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,991
Don't read too much into it.

571
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,283
What do I do?

572
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,830
What should I do?

573
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,345
Mom?

574
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:40,811
Why?

575
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,230
Why did you survive?

576
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,192
Why are you unscathed?
You should've been hurt too!

577
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,408
Be quiet. Don't make a sound.

578
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,245
His biological daughter's deaf,
and his only son is dead.

579
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,039
But you're unscathed,
and if you upset the chairman,

580
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,582
we'll get kicked out!

581
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,214
Yes, Hee-joo.

582
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,676
Don't say a word.

583
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,469
Hee-joo,

584
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,596
you're so shocked

585
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,599
that you can't speak, okay?

586
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,269
Mom, that hurts.

587
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,937
Shut your mouth!

588
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,814
You can't sacrifice your voice?

589
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,401
Not every life holds
the same value, Hee-joo.

590
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,153
We…

591
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,031
We can only stay
if the chairman feels sorry for us.

592
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,283
Do you understand?

593
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,876
How long do I have to not speak?

594
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,297
Until you turn into bubbles.

595
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,219
You're the Little Mermaid now.

596
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,842
Crap!

597
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:41,932
Come on!

598
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:45,811
Hey!

599
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,896
What was that?

600
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,150
I almost forgot.

601
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,986
What happened with him?

602
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:56,947
Who?

603
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,910
You know, the guy who got a naked picture
of his wife from some crazy man.

604
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:03,870
Was it an affair?

605
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,624
- I don't know.
- It's definitely an affair.

606
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,168
He'd know if he checked his wife.

607
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,254
He didn't.

608
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,714
Why not?

609
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,594
To try and get evidence?

610
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,639
He might not want to.

611
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,182
What?

612
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,902
To find out for himself.

613
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,157
He's a pervert.

614
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:47,163
Normal people would've lost it
and dug right in for the truth.

615
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,999
"Who are you sleeping with?"

616
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,213
But he can't even check for himself.

617
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,382
What do you think?

618
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,719
It's true love.

619
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,306
He loves his wife.

620
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,266
He's got to be a pervert.

621
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,315
The weather's cooled down,
so it's bearable now.

622
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,984
Are you okay?

623
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,905
Goodness. Where's my head at?

624
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,783
I didn't bring a blanket.
I'll be right back, okay?

625
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:37,273
Let's have a moment of silence to honor
our patriotic martyrs and fallen heroes.

626
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,900
Bow for a moment of silence.

627
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,430
DAD

628
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,771
A video call?

629
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,983
Dad?

630
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,945
<i>Sis!</i>

631
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,824
<i>How have you been?</i>

632
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:11,826
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

633
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,412
<i>Are you using it well?</i>

634
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,834
Yeah, I know.

635
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,587
I know you took it.

636
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,339
<i>You did well yesterday.</i>

637
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,423
<i>Sis, I like you.</i>

638
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,967
<i>You're quick to catch on.</i>

639
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,552
Wait.

640
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,475
What about my dad?

641
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,481
Starting now, I'll ask you questions,

642
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:43,483
and you'll answer.

643
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,110
Sis.

644
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,780
Using that phone

645
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,660
means you're threatening
Paik Sa-eon, right?

646
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,702
But for what?

647
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,121
<i>Well?</i>

648
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,998
<i>What are you asking for?</i>

649
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,501
<i>Answer me.</i>

650
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,462
<i>If not, I'm coming for that phone…</i>

651
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,383
right now.

652
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,428
A divorce.

653
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:13,930
<i>What?</i>

654
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,397
That's right!

655
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,234
Sis, that night…

656
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,902
I'd be pissed too.

657
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,241
<i>I swear, Paik Sa-eon is a total asshole.</i>

658
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,035
<i>So, Sis?</i>

659
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,204
Call him.

660
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,039
Keep calling him.

661
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,207
<i>Sis,</i>

662
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,128
<i>I like you. Do you know why?</i>

663
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,590
Because you have the same goal as us.

664
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,092
<i>So…</i>

665
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,887
<i>you can</i>

666
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,514
<i>keep the phone.</i>

667
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,892
But…

668
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:00,852
you have to promise me.

669
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,319
No backing out…

670
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,572
in the middle.

671
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,492
<i>You started this,</i>

672
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,578
<i>so you see it through.</i>

673
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,829
<i>Got it?</i>

674
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,041
<i>Sis!</i>

675
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,881
Hello? Dad!

676
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,225
Let's go.

677
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,710
I hope he'll be okay.

678
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,837
Let's keep in touch.

679
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,005
Of course.

680
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,715
Hee-joo!

681
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,968
She's his daughter. Na Jin-cheol's… What?

682
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,101
Fortunately, he wasn't hurt.

683
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,270
He's sedated and asleep.

684
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,481
I'm so sorry.
I stepped away for just a moment.

685
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,774
He suddenly disappeared.

686
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,112
When the caregiver found your father,
he was alone.

687
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,781
And these were with him.

688
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:44,372
But since your father is unharmed,
they could belong to someone else.

689
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,458
For now, we need to investigate it.

690
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,379
Yes, will you come with us
to file a report?

691
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,591
Are you awake?

692
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,852
Call.

693
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,609
Call.

694
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,866
Call him.

695
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,245
Sis.

696
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,710
Goodness!

697
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,670
Are you okay?

698
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,468
Call him.

699
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,598
Sis.

700
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,666
- What's that?
- What?

701
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,750
I'll do it.

702
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,794
What's wrong with this?

703
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,921
What's wrong with this thing?

704
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:19,676
What's wrong?

705
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,141
What's going on with that now?
What's happening?

706
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,898
What?

707
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,068
<i>You have to promise me.</i>

708
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,904
<i>No backing out in the middle.</i>

709
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,156
<i>You started this,</i>

710
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,867
<i>so you see it through.</i>

711
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:45,952
<i>Got it?</i>

712
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,705
<i>Sis!</i>

713
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,918
Call him.

714
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,089
Sis.

715
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,388
What is it?

716
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:06,973
What's wrong?

717
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,767
Are you feeling sick?

718
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,323
Oh, dear.

719
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,284
Are you okay?

720
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,961
<i>What was I expecting?</i>

721
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,046
<i>I was such a fool.</i>

722
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,220
<i>Has my life</i>

723
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,223
<i>ever been easy?</i>

724
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,105
<i>Why do I still have to bring</i>
<i>things like this</i>

725
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,065
<i>and teach you everything?</i>

726
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,823
<i>I can't do anything.</i>

727
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,912
<i>No one in this world is on my side.</i>

728
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,378
What?

729
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,925
What is that?

730
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,723
What? Why are they coming towards us?

731
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,392
- Did we do something wrong?
- No way!

732
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,936
We didn't do anything.

733
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:29,615
Hello!

734
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,705
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

735
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,964
You may leave now.

736
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,215
Pardon?

737
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,801
I'll come to the station
to file the report.

738
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,471
I'm sorry,
but what's your relationship with her?

739
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,309
We're family.

740
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,560
Excuse me?

741
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,072
She is…

742
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:12,950
my wife.

743
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:04,919
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

744
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:06,629
{\an8}<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

745
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,007
{\an8}<i>- Let's go!</i>
<i>- To the president's office!</i>

746
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,593
{\an8}<i>It's your chance to try</i>
<i>with your name on the line.</i>

747
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,512
{\an8}<i>You should start thinking about</i>

748
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,390
{\an8}<i>how you're going to handle</i>
<i>the aftermath if I get the job.</i>

749
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,226
{\an8}<i>Finally, I want to test you on something.</i>

750
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,020
{\an8}Can you not speak at all?

751
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,064
{\an8}<i>You know what day it is today, right?</i>

752
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,315
{\an8}<i>Do you know or not</i>

753
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,068
{\an8}<i>that my sister is back?</i>

754
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,154
{\an8}<i>Tell me if you're hiding anything.</i>

755
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,114
{\an8}<i>Hong Hee-joo…</i>

756
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,325
<i>can make sounds.</i>

757
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,249

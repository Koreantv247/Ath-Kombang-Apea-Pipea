1
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,115
He's so handsome.

3
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,367
He looks great in a suit.

4
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,776
Who's that?

5
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,861
Who's that woman?

6
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,362
Is she his wife?

7
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,407
- Is she Paik Sa-eon's wife?
- They look good together.

8
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,325
Don't be nervous.

9
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,078
Those people are looking at me, not you.

10
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,585
Sure, they might be curious about you.

11
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,712
But remember,

12
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:37,800
there can't be any misunderstandings,
interest, or rumors

13
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,886
about our relationship tonight.

14
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,847
Let's go.

15
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,324
{\an8}A DAY BEFORE

16
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,452
{\an8}<i>Heavy rainfall is expected nationwide</i>
<i>this year once again.</i>

17
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,704
{\an8}<i>With the monsoon season approaching,</i>

18
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,208
we must prepare in advance
for landslides, heavy rain, and typhoons.

19
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>- Experts have pointed out…</i>
- What's that?

20
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,754
What's wrong with that?

21
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,632
While unexpected damage is inevitable…

22
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,716
I think there's a lag.

23
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,636
How can it stop there?
It looks like she's cursing!

24
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,972
Inspections need to be strengthened.

25
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>Na You-ri, pass it over to the scene!</i>

26
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,268
We aim to review
last year's landslide site

27
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,895
and consider ways to reduce damage.

28
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,522
Reporter Park is on-site now.

29
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,573
This means…

30
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,993
a mountain, right?

31
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,537
The high middle mountain?

32
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,040
You did great.

33
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,961
I'll be honest.

34
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,089
Director Yoon's a superior,
but I can't stand how rude he is.

35
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,424
You really showed him

36
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,758
the peak.

37
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,345
I mean, the high mountain.

38
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,265
What the hell are you doing?

39
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,600
Put up the apology message now!

40
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,269
- Darn it.
- Okay!

41
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,104
<i>…roads have collapsed.</i>

42
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,480
WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE DISRUPTION

43
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,899
<i>Places with heavy traffic</i>
<i>were no exception…</i>

44
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,901
- Breaking news on the abduction incident.
- What?

45
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,903
The emergency briefing is in five minutes.

46
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,405
{\an8}But…

47
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,324
{\an8}OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

48
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>You-ri, breaking news</i>
<i>from the Presidential Office.</i>

49
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,922
A spokesperson briefing?

50
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,342
I keep seeing Sa-eon today.

51
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,472
Hee-joo, we're going live.

52
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,141
- Can you interpret--
<i>- No interpreter. Tell her to go.</i>

53
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,977
That's all for today. You may leave.
Great work.

54
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,948
They keep having the spokesperson do it.

55
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,659
Don't the Chief Security Officer
or Foreign Ministry

56
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,329
usually take turns briefing
for situations like this?

57
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,497
They did.

58
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,581
- They did?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,292
When the abduction happened.
You don't remember, do you?

60
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,253
That's why they keep
sending out Paik Sa-eon.

61
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,924
Paik Sa-eon overshadows
the Foreign Ministry and the ministers.

62
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,884
Hey, I think he's coming out.

63
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,264
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

64
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,907
I'm Paik Sa-eon, spokesperson
for the Presidential Office.

65
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,286
Today, from 1:48 p.m. to 4:20 p.m.

66
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,498
{\an8}<i>- Korea Standard Time…</i>
- Good vocalization and a great voice.

67
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,333
{\an8}What was he like as a news anchor?

68
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,543
The same as he is now.

69
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,130
He ranked first in preference,
trust, and ratings.

70
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,464
Excuse me.

71
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,593
Can you please be quiet?

72
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,847
I can't hear Sa-eon's voice well
because of you.

73
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,893
Being a fangirl even while she's working.

74
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,104
<i>We have made our utmost efforts.</i>

75
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,606
{\an8}<i>However, the armed group demands</i>

76
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,276
{\an8}<i>the immediate withdrawal</i>
<i>of South Korean Troops</i>

77
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,486
{\an8}<i>and payment of a ransom,</i>

78
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,364
{\an8}<i>warning that they will kill the hostages</i>

79
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,575
if their demands are not met.

80
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,492
- Kill?
- Kill?

81
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,416
I would like to state
the government's position on this.

82
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,589
When it comes to negotiations with
the kidnappers regarding the ransom…

83
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,887
There will be none.

84
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,726
The government considers their acts
as inhumane crimes

85
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,353
that cannot be tolerated

86
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,606
and will never compromise.

87
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,651
We promise to mobilize all
national resources to rescue our citizens,

88
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,363
including cooperation
with international organizations.

89
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,328
{\an8}<i>We will never compromise</i>
<i>on the principles we must uphold.</i>

90
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,247
{\an8}<i>Furthermore, the government</i>
<i>will use this opportunity</i>

91
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,666
{\an8}<i>to address the recent attacks</i>

92
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,794
<i>on third-country commercial vessels</i>
<i>in the Strait of Surmuz.</i>

93
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,797
<i>The illegal use of force</i>
<i>in international waters,</i>

94
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,051
<i>where the freedom of navigation</i>
<i>for vessels is guaranteed,</i>

95
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,261
<i>is viewed as a serious concern.</i>

96
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,263
<i>In the future,</i>

97
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,974
the government will strengthen
safety guidance activities

98
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,018
for citizens in high-risk areas

99
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,730
and implement measures
to prevent similar incidents

100
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,024
from occurring in the future.

101
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,831
As of 5:02 p.m.,

102
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,543
a temporary media control
will be implemented

103
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,628
under government authority.

104
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,004
- An embargo?
- Again?

105
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,798
Why are they trying to silence us?

106
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,758
Excuse me?

107
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,636
HBC, Jang Hyeok-jin.

108
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,014
Foreign media are already reporting this.

109
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,308
If our media stay silent,

110
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,768
sensational fake news

111
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,230
and unreliable personal broadcasts
will take over.

112
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,440
Is that okay with you?

113
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,235
Yes.

114
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,195
Excuse me?

115
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:37,535
Aren't reporters from our country's
leading media outlets all here?

116
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,704
If you don't mislead public opinion,

117
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,666
the citizens won't believe
what fake news says.

118
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,378
Be honest with us.

119
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,007
The current situation is bad, isn't it?

120
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,968
"Don't be gentle with the government."

121
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,596
You've come this far with that saying,

122
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,433
but I've never seen you
look so scared before.

123
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,604
Yes.

124
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,940
I'm terrified right now.

125
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,778
But am I the only one here
who is scared?

126
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,786
I ask all of the journalists here today.

127
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,663
Come together as one

128
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,375
and pray for the safe return
of our citizens.

129
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,502
I promise that the government

130
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,049
will do its utmost to ensure
not a single life is lost.

131
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,681
Check major headlines,
personal broadcasts, new media,

132
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,266
and comments on community posts.

133
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,393
- Report public opinion to me.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,520
Post live updates
from the negotiation team.

135
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,438
Yes, sir.

It's time…

146
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,710
you quit working.

147
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,132
You know the election camp
starts in a month, right?

148
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,384
Put aside external activities.

149
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,553
Focus on supporting him.

150
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,388
Of course.

151
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,515
I was going to ask her to quit anyway.

152
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,809
She never should've started working.

153
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,605
Last year, you suddenly
went on about not being able to breathe.

154
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,067
So I guess he let you work
to give you room to breathe.

155
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,487
But exposing your name
and face was something

156
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,990
that should have never happened.

157
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,701
Put an end to it quickly.

158
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,744
Also,

159
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,708
is there no improvement
in your selective mutism?

160
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,753
Is there really a need for improvement?

161
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,678
It's probably better
to keep her mouth shut.

162
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,225
Don't worry, ma'am.

163
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,978
I'll make sure nothing interferes
with the election…

164
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,980
God, that bitch.

165
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,359
I need to put that hag in her place
one day.

166
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,195
This is all your fault!

167
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,241
If you stole someone else's man,
you should do a better job!

168
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,745
You haven't even been
able to win your man's heart.

169
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,459
Who do you take after?
It certainly isn't me.

170
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,253
Don't forget, you're Chungwoon Daily News

00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,214
and the future president's

00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,489
- Mr. Paik?
- What about new media?

200
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,284
Yes, we've reviewed everything there too.

201
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,119
It's a mess.

202
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,539
Netizens have uncovered
your hidden background,

203
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,543
including FBI training
and NYPD hostage negotiation courses.

204
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,712
You're a negotiation expert.

205
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,673
They want you to be sent
to the negotiation team.

00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,509
It's a mess… What? Excuse me.

207
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,764
So, after a comprehensive review,

208
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,684
it appears that there are no speculative
articles or malicious reports…

There is.

210
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,645
Excuse me?

211
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,691
A very malicious report
that distorts the facts.

212
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,901
Where?

213
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,861
Here. Take care of it.

214
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,825

00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,166
What? Come on.

Jang Hyeok-jin from HBC is at it again.

Yeah.

218
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,257
He seems friendly,
but then he throws in a curveball.

219
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,175
But…

220
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,471
what do we say when we request a deletion?

221
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,264
Emotional distress

222
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,266
caused by malicious distortion?

223
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,392
Hysteria?

224
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,852
- Hysteria?
- Hysteria.

225
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,853
Hysteria?

227

This is the negotiation team's timeline.

228
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,954
- You got a call.
- Who is it this time?

229
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,583
A strange number.

230
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,418
I think it's from abroad.

231
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,129
What shall I do?

00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,554

233
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,308
Please speak.

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,106
- I'll hang up if you don't.
<i>- Paik Sa-eon.</i>

235
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,154
<i>So it is really you.</i>

236
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,781
What is this?

237
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,160
<i>What? You don't like my voice?</i>

238
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,955
Where are you?

239
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,707
It's not a domestic number.

240
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,167
Who are you affiliated with?

241
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,211
<i>I'll kill…</i>

242
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,964
<i>I'm going to kill</i>

243
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,799
<i>your wife.</i>

244
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,015
The voice just now…

245
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,016
Get back to work.

246
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,602
Yes, sir.

247
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,149
MOTHER

248
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,279
It's me.

249
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,114
Did you see her today?

250
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,409
What time did you part ways?

251
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,081
With my mother-in-law?

252
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,791
SON-IN-LAW

253
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,626
What?

254
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,713
Goodness. It's my son-in-law.

255
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,172
I thought you were busy.

256
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,802
Your face is on every channel today.

257
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,471
My son-in-law looks amazing on screen.

258
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,766
What? Hee-joo?

259
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>Yeah, I brought her home.</i>
<i>I'll send her off after dinner.</i>

260
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,480
Is that so?

261
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,482
Okay, have a good night.

262
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,406
- Mr. Kang?
- Yes, sir?

263
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,326
406-000-1290. Trace this number for me.

264
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,994
- What?
- Did you memorize it?

265
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,955
- It's a phishing scam.
- Four, zero…

266
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,042
406-000-1290. I'll trace it.

267
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,794
Yeah, okay. You do that.

268
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,339
Former journalists
really are a different breed.

269
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,299
They're fast.

270
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,897
Is she dead?

271
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,610
You said you'd kill her.

272
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,653
Did you kill her?

273
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,824
Do you even know who my wife is?

274
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,744
Look here.

275
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,829
Don't you watch the news?

276
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,668
I'm far too busy
for these types of prank calls today.

277
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,753
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

278
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,673
<i>I dare you to hang up on me again.</i>

279
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,841
What if I do?

280
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,009
<i>I have…</i>

281
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,514
<i>a knife to your wife's throat right now.</i>

282
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,935
<i>I'll really kill her.</i>

283
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,894
<i>Well?</i>

284
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,271
<i>- I'll kill her.</i>
- Okay.

285
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,315
- Try it.
<i>- What?</i>

286
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,400
Don't just talk about it, do it.

287
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,485
<i>Not yet…</i>

288
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,864
<i>We haven't talked about money yet.</i>

289
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>How much will you…</i>

290
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,578
<i>pay for the ransom?</i>

291
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,790
The ransom?

292
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,421
<i>Listen up.</i>

293
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,383
<i>You can demand however much you want.</i>

294
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,096
<i>But there will be no ransom.</i>

295
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,849
<i>So don't call me again.</i>

296
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,778
Darn it.

297
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,591
I seriously love this expression the most.

298
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,391
Eyes on the road.

299
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,105
Sis, do you get it now?

300
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,942
That this isn't a joke?

301
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:47,861
But…

302
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,072
why does your husband think I'm joking?

303
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,700
What the hell did he mean earlier?

304
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,119
Why did he ask me
if I knew who his wife was?

305
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,662
It's you, isn't it?

306
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,046
Wait. Or does he have another wife?

307
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,091
I'm just teasing.

308
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,888
Well, it doesn't matter
if he has more than one wife.

309
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,265
It's none of my business,

310
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,102
but the wife Sa-eon cares about the most

311
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,396
better be you, Sis.

312
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,900
That's how you'll survive this.

313
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,155
Now, let's call him again.

314
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,721
PAIK SA-EON

315
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,767
Is he going to ignore me again?

316
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,185
Again?

317
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,107
Paik Sa-eon!

318
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,068
This bastard!

319
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,284
It's okay. It's all good.

320
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,461
Sis.

321
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,549
Do you know what kind of phone this is?

322
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,509
This…

323
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,220
can only call Paik Sa-eon.

324
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,640
The voice modulation
is also automatic.

325
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,643
Also, it…

326
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,978
What was it again?

327
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,231
Yeah! That!

328
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,026
{\an8}It uses a VPN.

329
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,111
{\an8}It can't be tracked for ten minutes.

330
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,530
I already prepped this car in advance too.

331
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,282
That's why it moves on its own.

332
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,620
I'm so well prepared.

333
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,247
But this guy,

334
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,542
Paik Sa-eon, isn't picking up the phone!

335
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:09,961
PAIK SA-EON

336
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,714
- Paik Sa-eon.
<i>- What?</i>

337
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,051
<i>Hello, just a moment.</i>

338
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,886
<i>I'll put Mr. Paik on the phone.</i>

339
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,096
<i>I told you not to answer it. Why did you?</i>

340
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,515
<i>I pressed the button by mistake.</i>

341
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,309
It's a phishing scam.

342
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,146
Listen up, you pathetic loser scumbag.

343
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,316
What did I say?
I told you not to call me again.

344
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,401
<i>I'm sure I was clear too.</i>

345
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,112
<i>I'm going to kill your wife.</i>

346
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,241
Fine, then hurry up and do it.

347
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:41,868
And…

348
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,164
<i>Call me when there's a corpse.</i>

349
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,939
<i>Call me when there's a corpse.</i>

350
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,652
Mr. Paik, Argan called through the hotline
and requests your presence.

351
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,115
Don't touch my things.

352
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,032
Yes, sir.

353
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,015
What the hell? What are you doing?

354
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,645
You crazy bitch!

355
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,482
Damn it!

356
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,026
Get your hands off it!

357
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,445
Damn it!

358
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,073
Stop the car!

359
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,721
<i>The government announced</i>
<i>at 6:55 p.m. today</i>

360
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,890
<i>that negotiations successfully ended,</i>

361
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:31,686
<i>and the Argan armed group</i>
<i>agreed to release all Korean hostages.</i>

362
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,856
<i>Here is a statement</i>
<i>from spokesperson Paik Sa-eon.</i>

363
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:39,903
<i>Thank you to the hostages and the public</i>
<i>for your trust and endurance</i>

364
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:46,910
<i>and to the media for your cooperation</i>
<i>in ensuring national security and safety.</i>

365
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,580
We also express our gratitude

366
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,583
to the Argan government
and allied international organizations,

367
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,505
and we will take all necessary measures
to ensure the safe return of the hostages.

368
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,784
Can I get an exclusive interview,
Mr. Paik?

369
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,743
Just a moment.

370
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,744
Wait.

371
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,788
Wait! My arm! It's stuck!

372
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,165
Come on, you darn punk!

373
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,627
Why are you heading out so early?
It's not even 9:00 yet.

374
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,711
Let's grab a drink.

375
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,298
Did you wait to see
what time I clocked out?

376
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,758
Are you a stalker?

377
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,552
Yeah, man.

378
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,971
I noticed you took down
all of my pictures.

379
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,556
Why? Didn't like them?

380
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,808
A journalist should report the truth.

381
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,601
You shouldn't distort it.

382
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,353
I didn't distort it. It's PR.

383
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,437
Come on.

384
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,649
- You lack humanity.
- I didn't ask you to do that.

385
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,984
I never will, either.

386
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,653
Hey, Sa-eon? Open the door. Hey!

387
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,737
Stop… Hey!

388
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,073
Hey, Sa-eon! Hey!

389
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,701
Darn…

390
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,582
What?

391
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,585
What?

392
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,088
Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

393
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,382
Darn it.

394
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,844
Hyeok-jin, I have a favor to ask.

395
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,562
What's wrong with you? You're crazy!

396
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,151
Hey, I'm sorry!

397
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,903
I was wrong. I won't do it again.

398
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,487
In front of us! There!

399
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,492
Trace this number as quickly as possible.

400
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,286
What? What is it?

401
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,871
Hey, in front of us!

402
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,792
It's a phishing scam,
but I have a bad feeling.

403
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,670
A bad feeling? So do I.

404
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,422
Slow down, man!

405
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,182
I never assumed my number would be safe
from scammers.

406
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,435
But a voice modulator?

407
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,770
He's pulling out all the stops.

408
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,398
So I just can't let it go.

409
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,192
What? Phishing? Modulator?

410
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,235
Is this a case?

411
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,279
Just look into the number.

412
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,283
{\an8}406-000-1290?

413
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,040
Get out. We're done.

414
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,250
Okay.

415
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:42,877
I'm off.

416
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:52,971
Goodness.

417
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,014
That punk.

418
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,016
Why is he in such a hurry?

419
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,738
You're alive.

420
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,285
I received…

421
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,580
a ridiculous phone call today.

422
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,332
Someone said…

423
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,085
they would kill you.

424
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,421
Well, "my wife," to be exact.

425
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,426
Anyway,

426
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,346
you're alive and well.

427
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,980
By the way, what's with the food?

428
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,066
Didn't you have dinner with your mom?

429
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,786
What happened?

430
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,706
You can't trace it?

431
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,709
It's not using the cell towers.

432
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,544
We can't trace it with just a number.

433
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,843
<i>Hey, 406 is an area code in the States.</i>

434
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,636
<i>And it's a virtual phone number.</i>

435
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,140
Is it because it's a virtual phone number?

436
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,475
So is real-time tracking the only way?

437
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,060
<i>Yes, how did you know?</i>

438
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,480
And to track it in real time,
they have to call again.

439
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,820
So I have to wait for his call?

440
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,155
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

441
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,450
And the call must last
at least ten minutes.

442
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,493
I'm sure you already know,

443
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,537
but we need personal information
to identify--

444
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,080
- It's a man.
<i>- Sorry?</i>

445
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,708
<i>But the voice was modulated.</i>

446
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,168
It's a man. I'm sure of it.

447
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,004
And he was on drugs
or not in his right mind.

448
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,905
{\an8}He made the threatening call
at the perfect time.

449
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,698
It was clear he was trying
to shake me up

450
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,159
during a national emergency.

451
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,455
<i>Yes, there are many groups</i>
<i>that would be glad to see you fail.</i>

452
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,791
Is your wife okay?

453
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,253
Of course, she's fine.

454
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,839
But just in case,
I want her to be under protection.

455
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,549
Without them knowing she's my wife.

456
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,385
<i>Okay. There's a team I can trust.</i>

457
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,721
I'll call them myself.
Just give me the number.

458
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,847
Yes, sir.

459
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,642
<i>Also, about the event</i>
<i>at the British Embassy tomorrow,</i>

460
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,478
didn't you say we needed
a sign language interpreter?

461
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,272
Did you find one?

462
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,865
Come and sit.

463
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,594
There's an event at the British Embassy
tomorrow at 6:00 p.m.

464
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,347
I'll send someone
to pick you up by 5:00, so be ready.

465
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,353
The ambassador's wife is deaf,
so we need a sign language interpreter.

466
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,648
It's not a couple's event or anything.
Don't get the wrong idea.

467
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,202
MOM

468
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:58,878
MOM

469
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,301
<i>Where are you? Are you at home?</i>
<i>Why won't you pick up?</i>

470
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,136
<i>Sa-eon was looking for you earlier.</i>

471
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,932
WHY WAS HE LOOKING FOR ME?

472
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,145
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>He asked me if I was with you.</i>

473
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,690
<i>I said I'd send you home after dinner,</i>
<i>so tell him so when he comes home.</i>

474
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,069
{\an8}MOM

475
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,615
MOM

476
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,116
<i>You listen to me.</i>

477
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,744
<i>There's just a month left</i>
<i>until the presidential campaign.</i>

478
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,663
You probably won't need to show yourself,

479
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,292
but just in case, see the dermatologist
and plastic surgeon starting tomorrow.

480
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,002
<i>And another thing.</i>

481
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,340
When did you stop going to the clinic?

482
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,259
No wonder why you're not pregnant!

483
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,388
<i>I'll send the medicine tomorrow,</i>
<i>so be ready to get in shape.</i>

484
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,764
<i>Are you listening?</i>

485
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,062
<i>I can't tell if you're listening</i>
<i>since you're completely silent.</i>

486
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,648
<i>It's just a month left.</i>

487
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,567
<i>I told you to quit your job.</i>

488
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,029
{\an8}3 YEARS AGO

489
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,158
Take it off.

490
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,828
It doesn't belong to you.
You're just the stand-in.

491
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,538
Take it off.

492
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,085
The wedding will be held in private.

493
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,965
You'll never have to pretend
to be my wife in front of others again.

494
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,905
Are you going to strip naked?

495
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,626
It's our wedding vows.

496
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,301
You don't have to read it all,
just remember this.

497
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,137
One, the bride cannot initiate a divorce.

498
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,057
Two, especially
not during the election period.

499
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,394
Three, you will not publicly disclose
your name or face as Paik Sa-eon's wife.

500
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:06,106
If any of these is violated,
the penalty will be two billion won.

501
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,830
Get up.

502
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,208
I said, get up.

503
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,007
You're so stubborn.

504
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,229
Forget the illusion that we're married.

505
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,066
You were sent…

506
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,944
as a hostage to me.

507
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,666
{\an8}PAIK SA-EON'S MARRIAGE

508
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,919
{\an8}SPOKESPERSON PAIK'S WEDDING
SUDDENLY TURNED PRIVATE

509
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:16,093
{\an8}SOME SAY THE WEDDING WAS HELD IN PRIVATE
TO HIDE THE BRIDE FROM THE PUBLIC

510
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,445
SIGN IS A LANGUAGE
SEONGNANG-GU SIGN LANGUAGE CENTER

511
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,288
<i>Come on, asshole! Come at me!</i>

512
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,372
<i>Come!</i>

513
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,960
<i>Come at me if you have a death wish!</i>
<i>You bastards!</i>

514
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,629
Who is it at this hour?

515
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,756
STUDIO
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

516
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,050
<i>We meet again.</i>

517
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,260
Goodness.

518
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,220
What is that?

519
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,223
<i>Didn't I tell you not to run your mouth?</i>

520
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,224
What's she doing?

521
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,684
<i>Do you want to lose your teeth?</i>

522
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,647
{\an8}<i>You must have a death wish, bastard.</i>
<i>Eyes down!</i>

523
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,898
Hee-joo?

524
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,651
What are you doing?

525
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,945
I was just practicing.

526
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,783
What kind of intense practice is this?

527
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,910
Are you interpreting for the police?

528
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,246
Or did a loan shark ask
for an interpreter? Is the debtor deaf?

529
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,539
It's not like that.

530
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,333
But you've never done this before.

531
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,210
You really startled me.

532
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,795
You scared me.

533
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,255
Just do what you usually do.

534
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,341
Watch the video you practice with.

535
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,804
The one with Paik Sa-eon.

536
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,558
There have been a lot of briefings lately.
Want me to bring you some?

537
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,811
{\an8}No, I don't need them.

538
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,312
Why not?

539
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,191
You said you liked his videos
because they're like a textbook.

540
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,735
You said you wanted to be on-screen

541
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,780
with Paik Sa-eon
even if it was just a brief moment.

542
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:05,536
{\an8}I'm done with Paik Sa-eon's videos.
I've done enough already.

543
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:41,655
I apologize.

544
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,574
I'm sorry we're late.

545
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,534
It's fine.

546
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,717
Let's go.

547
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,475
Wow. That's so nice.

548
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:34,101
{\an8}I didn't know
the spokesperson's wife could sign.

549
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,062
{\an8}I'm not the spokesperson's wife.

550
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:44,236
{\an8}I'm just here as an interpreter.
There's no personal relationship.

551
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,014
To be honest,

552
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,433
my wife has a disability too.

553
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,241
Because my wife…

554
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,787
…is my weakness.

555
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,465
I face attacks from all sides.

556
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:50,260
In a way, you could say
I'm the government's official scapegoat.

557
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,845
So I don't want

558
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,141
my wife to be exposed
to indiscriminate attacks like I am.

559
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,479
Yes, she's my weakness.

560
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,583
TEXT MESSAGE

561
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,711
<i>We're on standby.</i>

562
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,546
<i>We can track it once you get the call,</i>

563
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,215
<i>so just be mindful of the time.</i>

564
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,651
Are you trying to get drunk?

565
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,654
Or are you already drunk?

566
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,957
I'LL GO HOME IF I'M DONE HERE

567
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,999
You can't.

568
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,338
You just have to stand quietly next to me.

569
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,339
Is that so hard?

570
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:12,968
Stay.

571
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,681
Go sit somewhere if your legs hurt.
Stop drinking.

572
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,359
{\an8}Do you think I can't hear
just because I can't speak?

573
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,239
{\an8}Do you think I can't feel emotions?

574
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,577
{\an8}You don't want to expose me
to indiscriminate attacks?

575
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,497
{\an8}Then why am I hurt and torn apart already?

576
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,002
{\an8}Did you say I was your weakness?

577
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,463
{\an8}A weakness…

578
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,382
{\an8}is a wound that's prone to infection.

579
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,134
{\an8}When someone touches it, you flinch,

580
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,094
{\an8}tremble, and desperately defend it.

581
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,554
{\an8}That's a weakness.

582
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,807
{\an8}But you didn't act like that yesterday.

583
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,978
{\an8}You despicable jerk.

584
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:09,649
Did you just curse at me?

585
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,330
{\an8}But then, I might not be the wife

586
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,373
{\an8}you were just talking about.

587
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,368
Hello?

588
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,336
Speak, 406.

589
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,634
Should I go first?

590
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,847
My wife is safe.

591
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,558
Did you fail to kill her?

592
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,394
Why won't you speak?

593
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,479
You went on and on yesterday.

594
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,189
Wait.

595
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,360
I didn't have time
to listen to your rambling.

596
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,915
Then let's hear your plan on how
you're going to hurt her in the future.

597
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,752
I've got plenty of free time today.

598
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,755
<i>True,</i>

599
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,633
<i>I guess there's not much to do at a party.</i>

600
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,969
<i>I'm glad you're having a good time.</i>

601
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,222
<i>You're good</i>
<i>at playing the lovestruck fool.</i>

602
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,602
<i>Are you surprised by how close I am?</i>

603
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:53,855
<i>Yeah.</i>

604
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,859
<i>I've been watching you the whole time,</i>
<i>but you didn't notice.</i>

605
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,487
- Stop bluffing.
<i>- Bluffing?</i>

606
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,031
How could someone like you get in here?

607
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,283
You need an invitation to--

608
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,202
<i>You've hardly eaten anything.</i>

609
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,204
<i>Eat something.</i>

610
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,248
<i>The bruschetta with the truffle on top</i>
<i>was really good.</i>

611
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,767
Who are you?

612
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,773
<i>Are you curious about me now?</i>

613
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,942
Stop laughing and answer me. Who are you?

614
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,236
How did you get in here?

615
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,113
<i>Yeah, I'll answer you.</i>

616
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,116
<i>The answer to the question</i>
<i>you asked earlier.</i>

617
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,580
<i>You asked me…</i>

618
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,876
<i>how I plan on hurting your wife.</i>

619
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,172
Don't mess around.

620
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,883
How dare you come here?

621
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,762
<i>You look flustered.</i>

622
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,723
<i>You should've done this yesterday.</i>

623
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:51,806
Who are you?

624
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,850
What are you doing?

625
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,018
<i>Hello?</i>

626
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,020
<i>What's wrong? Did something happen?</i>

627
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,563
I apologize.

628
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,820
<i>What was that? You're way off base.</i>

629
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,448
<i>You said I can't be possibly here.</i>

630
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,451
A loser like you is probably hiding
and snickering in your room.

631
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:16,164
Do you really think someone like you
could do anything to my wife?

632
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,461
Listen up, if you wanted to threaten me,
you chose the wrong hostage.

633
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,338
My wife? Who's my wife?

634
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,672
Have you even seen her?

635
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,009
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>The world has no idea who she is.</i>

636
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,470
<i>They don't know who your real wife is.</i>

637
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,930
<i>But I do.</i>

638
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,848
<i>Hong Hee-joo</i>

639
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,601
<i>isn't your real wife.</i>

640
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:46,152
<i>Your real wife is the one you were</i>
<i>supposed to marry, your real fiancée.</i>

641
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,157
<i>The eldest daughter of the chairman</i>
<i>of Chungwoon Daily News, Hong In-a.</i>

642
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:56,996
<i>She ran away the day before the wedding,</i>
<i>and I heard no one knows where she is.</i>

643
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,916
<i>But still,</i>

644
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,545
<i>how could you marry her sister instead?</i>

645
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,672
<i>Isn't that outrageous?</i>

646
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,260
<i>But then,</i>
<i>Chungwoon Daily News and your family</i>

647
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,720
<i>are in an inseparable</i>
<i>symbiotic relationship.</i>

648
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:17,559
<i>You had to go through with the marriage,</i>
<i>so you married her sister as a hostage?</i>

649
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,728
<i>Either way, I bet people</i>
<i>will love that. Right?</i>

650
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,272
<i>It's so shocking.</i>

651
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:26,151
<i>Paik Sa-eon,</i>
<i>the clean and great spokesperson,</i>

652
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,403
<i>rides both sisters like an elevator.</i>

653
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,531
<i>On and off whenever he wants.</i>

654
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,580
<i>What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?</i>

655
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,250
<i>Don't you want to know how I know</i>
<i>a secret nobody else knows?</i>

656
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,753
<i>Say something, Paik Sa-eon!</i>

657
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,007
What do you want?

658
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,967
<i>Yeah, good job.</i>

659
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,178
<i>That's the correct answer.</i>

660
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,308
Tell me…

661
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,102
what you want.

662
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,063
<i>Then listen carefully.</i>

663
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,567
<i>I'm going to tell you my demands now.</i>

664
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,822
<i>Get rid of Hong Hee-joo</i>

665
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,033
<i>and get back with your real fiancée.</i>

666
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:20,371
<i>You don't need Hong Hee-joo</i>
<i>in your life anyway, do you?</i>

667
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,808
<i>Listen up, you pathetic loser scumbag.</i>

668
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,603
<i>What did I say?</i>
<i>I told you not to call me again.</i>

669
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,772
I'm sure I was clear too.

670
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,775
I'm going to kill your wife.

671
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,151
<i>Then hurry up and do it.</i>

672
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,903
<i>And…</i>

673
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,032
<i>Call me when there's a corpse.</i>

674
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,847
That asshole.

675
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,980
Call him back.

676
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,189
What?

677
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,527
I have something to say to him,
so call him back now!

678
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,415
This is exhilarating.

679
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,382
Pick up.

680
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,427
Pick up.

681
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,013
Pick up!

682
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,765
Pick up!

683
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,315
Do you understand?

684
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:56,235
Unless you want your personal life
to ruin your father's election,

685
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,612
return things to what they were.

686
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,990
If you don't,
I'll expose the secrets of your marriage.

687
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,000
Hey, man. Are you scared?

688
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:17,006
It's funny Paik Sa-eon would be scared
because of a loser like me.

689
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,143
You have until tomorrow to decide.

690
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,938
Or we can settle for two billion won.
You have until tomorrow.

691
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,774
<i>Are you done?</i>

692
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,744
Tell me,

693
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:51,708
how do punks like you
never change your repertoire?

694
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,001
What?

695
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,795
<i>If you want to threaten me,</i>

696
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,547
you should study up on me first.

697
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,633
There are hundreds of reporters

698
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,468
<i>eager to get me to speak at any cost.</i>

699
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,972
{\an8}<i>Turning a lame scandal into fake news</i>
<i>is easy for me.</i>

700
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,934
<i>And I can get rid of</i>
<i>a pathetic blackmailer with my eyes shut.</i>

701
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,811
So why would I?

702
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,191
Why did you think
I'd accept the presumptuous demand

703
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,568
to abandon Hong Hee-joo?

704
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:23,990
<i>Why are you dragging my person into this?</i>

705
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,494
"My person"?

706
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,872
Don't be ridiculous!

707
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:36,419
Hey, do you know what happened
to your precious person yesterday?

708
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,587
She almost died.

709
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,715
No, I mean, I almost killed her!

710
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,552
I kidnapped her in her car,
choked her, and grabbed her by the hair.

711
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,680
I had a knife to her.
I was going to kill her. Do you get it?

712
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:49,474
<i>So?</i>

713
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,686
What do you mean? It was scary.

714
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,605
She was terrified!

715
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,859
So she was scared. What happened next?

716
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:04,197
I was about to kill her,
and she couldn't even beg for her life.

717
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,365
Since she can't speak.

718
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,160
<i>Then?</i>

719
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:14,415
Then you ruthlessly hung up the phone,
saying to call when there's a corpse!

720
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,210
Yeah, Hong Hee-joo
really could've ended up dead.

721
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,295
The car rolled on the slippery road!

722
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,721
<i>I've never been…</i>

723
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,558
<i>more curious about a man before.</i>

724
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,859
Forget about getting arrested, 406.

725
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,321
I promise,

726
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,658
I'm going to catch you.

727
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,553
Wait…

728
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:12,682
Am I screwed, or did he fall for it?

729
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:56,851
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

730
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,561
{\an8}<i>Who was he?</i>

731
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,521
{\an8}<i>Did you see his face?</i>

732
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,189
{\an8}<i>Paik Sa-eon is scared.</i>

733
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,400
{\an8}<i>What is this?</i>

734
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,236
{\an8}<i>It's Hong Hee-joo's thigh.</i>

735
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,488
{\an8}Have you never seen her naked?

736
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,741
{\an8}I must be crazy!

737
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,993
{\an8}<i>What the heck? Why is he coming?</i>

738
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,871
{\an8}<i>Hee-joo, you're doing well, right?</i>

739
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,624
{\an8}A man?

740
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,625
{\an8}Were you close?

741
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,462
{\an8}<i>Lately, nothing makes sense.</i>

742
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,590
{\an8}<i>There can't be a Hong Hee-joo</i>
<i>I don't know about.</i>

743
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:28,716
{\an8}<i>By any chance,</i>

744
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,969
<i>are you close to me?</i>

745
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:38,017
